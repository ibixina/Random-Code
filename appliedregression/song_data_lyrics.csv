I lost a friend Somewhere along in the bitterness And I would have stayed up with you all night Had I known how to save a life As he begins to raise his voice You lower yours and grant him one last choice Drive until you lose the road Or break with the ones you've followed He will do one of two things He will admit to everything Or he'll say he's just not the same And you'll begin to wonder why you came Where did I go wrong?

100,For You I Will (Confidence),Teddy Geiger,2006,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/teddygeiger/foryouiwillconfidence.html,"""Wandering the streets, in a world underneath it all Nothing seems to be, nothing tastes as sweet As what I can't have Like you and the way that you're twisting your hair round your finger Tonight I'm not afraid to tell you What I feel about you. I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have and cannon ball into the water I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have For you I will For you I will Forgive me if I st-stutter From all of the clutter in my head Cause I could fall asleep in those eyes Like a water bed Do I seem familiar, I've crossed you in hallways a thousand times, no more camouflage I want to be exposed, and not be afraid to fall. I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have And cannon ball into the water I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have For you I will You always want what you can't have But I've got to try I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have For you I will For you I will For you I will For you If I could dim the lights in the mall And create a mood I would Shout out your name so it echoes in every room, yeah That's what I'd do, That's what I'd do, That's what I'd do, To get through to you I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have And cannon ball into the water I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have For you I will You always want what you can't have But I've got to try I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have For you I will For you I will For you I will For you I will"""
