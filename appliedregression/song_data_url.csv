Bad Day Lyrics
Where is the moment we needed the most?
You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost
They tell me your blue skies fade to gray
They tell me your passion's gone away
And I don't need no carryin' on
You stand in the line just to hit a new low
You're faking a smile with the coffee to go
You tell me your life's been way off line
You're falling to pieces every time
And I don't need no carryin' on
Because you had a bad day, you're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know, you tell me, don't lie
You work at a smile and you go for a ride
You had a bad day, the camera don't lie
You're coming back down and you really don't mind
You had a bad day
You had a bad day
Well, you need a blue sky holiday
The point is they laugh at what you say
And I don't need no carryin' on
You had a bad day, you're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know, you tell me, don't lie
You work at a smile and you go for a ride
You had a bad day, the camera don't lie
You're coming back down and you really don't mind
You had a bad day
Ooh, a holiday
Sometimes, the system goes on the blink and the whole thing turns out wrong
You might not make it back and you know that you could be, well, oh, that strong
And I'm not wrong
Yeah, yeah, yeah
[Refrain]
So where is the passion when you need it the most?
Oh, you and I
You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost
'Cause you had a bad day, you're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know, you tell me, don't lie
You work at a smile and you go for a ride
You had a bad day, you've seen what you're like
And how does it feel? One more time
You had a bad day
You had a bad day (Ah, yeah, yeah)
Had a bad day (Ah, a holiday)
Had a bad day (Ah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah)
Had a bad day (Ah)"

You’re Beautiful Lyrics
My life is brilliant
My life is brilliant
My love is pure
I saw an angel
Of that I'm sure
She smiled at me on the subway
She was with another man
But I won't lose no sleep on that
'Cause I've got a plan
You're beautiful
You're beautiful
You're beautiful, it's true
I saw your face in a crowded place
And I don't know what to do
'Cause I'll never be with you
Yes, she caught my eye
As I walked on by
She could see from my face that I was
Fucking high
And I don't think that I'll see her again
But we shared a moment that will last till the end
You're beautiful
You're beautiful
You're beautiful, it's true
I saw your face in a crowded place
And I don't know what to do
'Cause I'll never be with you
Ba, la, la, na
Ba, la, la, na
Ba, la, la, na, na
You're beautiful
You're beautiful
You're beautiful, it's true
There must be an angel with a smile on her face
When she thought up that I should be with you
But it's time to face the truth
I will never be with you"

Unwritten Lyrics
I am unwritten
Can't read my mind
I'm undefined
I'm just beginning
The pen's in my hand
Ending: unplanned
Staring at the blank page before you
Open up the dirty window
Let the sun illuminate the words that you cannot find
Reaching for something in the distance
So close you can almost taste it
Release your inhibitions
Feel the rain on your skin
No one else can feel it for you
Only you can let it in
No one else, no one else
Can speak the words on your lips
Drench yourself in words unspoken
Live your life with arms wide open
Today is where your book begins
The rest is still unwritten
Yeah
Oh, oh
I break tradition
Sometimes my tries
Are outside the lines, yeah, yeah
We've been conditioned
To not make mistakes
But I can't live that way, no, oh
Staring at the
blank page
before you
Open up the dirty window
Let the sun illuminate the words that you cannot find
Reaching for something in the distance
So close you can almost taste it
Release your inhibitions
Feel the rain on your skin
No one else can feel it for you
Only you can let it in
No one else, no one else
Can speak the words on your lips
Drench yourself in words unspoken
Live your life with arms wide open
Today is where your book begins
Feel the rain on your skin
No one else can feel it for you
Only you can let it in
No one else, no one else
Can speak the words on your lips
Drench yourself in words unspoken
Live your life with arms wide open
Today is where your book begins
The rest is still unwritten
Woah
Ooh, oh, woah
Oh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah
Staring at the blank page before you
Open up the dirty window
Let the sun illuminate the words that you cannot find
Reaching for something in the distance
So close you can almost taste it
Release your inhibitions
Feel the rain on your skin
No one else can feel it for you
Only you can let it in
No one else, no one else
Can speak the words on your lips
Drench yourself in words unspoken
Live your life with arms wide open
Today is where your book begins
Feel the rain on your skin
No one else can feel it for you
Only you can let it in
No one else, no one else
Can speak the words on your lips
Drench yourself in words unspoken
Live your life with arms wide open
Today is where your book begins
The rest is still unwritten
The rest is still unwritten
The rest is still unwritten
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah"

Crazy Lyrics
I remember when
I remember, I remember when I lost my mind
There was something so pleasant about that place
Even your emotions have an echo in so much space, mm
And when you're out there without care
Yeah, I was out of touch
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough
I just knew too much, mm
Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Possibly
And I hope that you are having the time of your life
But think twice, that's my only advice, mm
Come on now, who do you
Who do you, who do you, who do you think you are?
Ha, ha, ha, bless your soul
You really think you're in control?
Well, I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
Just like me
My heroes had the heart to lose their lives out on the limb
And all I remember is thinkin' I wanna be like them, mhm
Ever since I was little
Ever since I was little, it looked like fun
And it's no coincidence I've come
And I can die when I'm done
But maybe I'm crazy
Maybe you're crazy
Maybe we're crazy
Probably
Mm-woah, ooh
Ooh, woo-ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh-hoo, mhm"

Rap Critic Reviews: “Ridin’” by Chamillionaire feat. Krayzie Bone” Lyrics
Hi. I'm the Rap Critic.
Let's talk about Chamillionaire. Now, back in the mid 2000's, there was a short time when Texas was all the rage in Hip-Hop. For a brief 2 or 3 years, you couldn't escape Houston rappers such as Mike Jones, Paul Wall, Lil Flip, and even old school cats like UGK started coming back on the scene. But among these emcees, few of them had as big a hit as Chamillionaire with Ridin', a forceful tune with a vibrating bass line, thumping drums, driving synths, and an unforgettable hook that brought him a number one hit on the billboard charts. Although, for a song that was such a club banger, it was actually an anthem against racial prejudice embedded in the American Police force, the likes of which we hadn't seen achieve such popularity since… well, N.W.A. For those who don't know, the phrase ""ridin' dirty"" refers to having something illegal in your car while driving, usually drugs. And in the context of the chorus...
They see me rollin, They hatin
Patrolling they tryin to catch me ridin dirty
Tryin to catch me ridin dirty
He's referring to racist cops who use their badge as an excuse to hassle people of color because they assume if they're rollin' in a nice ride, it MUST be because they're dealing drugs, and so these racist cops can't wait to reaffirm their biased views and pull over a black man with the intent of, ""put them in their place,"" as it were, that place being jail. And this is a very real problem. Seeing that black people are only about 13 percent of the American population, there is a disproportionate amount of Black people who are arrested for having marijuana in comparison to white people being arrested for having it, and if you've ever been to a predominantly white college, you know that that's not simply because white kids ""don't have as much""… So, in a slick way, this song is calling out that racial disparity, and by the sing-song nature of the chorus, it seems to take pleasure in subverting the cops' expectations
Grindin' to see if they can see me lean
I'm tinted so it ain't easy to be seen
Okay, so, we start off with Chamillionaire telling us of his desire to be seen, quickly followed by him telling us that because his car's tinted, you can't really see him… okay… not the strongest way to start a song like this, but whatever…
Ride with a new chick, she like hold up
AUGH!!! *calms down*
Sorry, after that ""We Dem Boyz"" review, I'd just rather not hear that phrase in a rap song for a while
Next to the playstation controller
Is a full clip in my pistola, Send a jacker into a coma
Alright, here he's saying that if you try to steal his stuff, he'll… wait, wasn't this song about the police?
Send a jacker into a coma
Girl you ain't know, I'm crazy like Krayzie Bone
Wait, is he telling all of this to the girl he's in the car with? Well, I guess telling her that he can protect himself from any carjackers probably would make her feel safe, but… maybe when talking to a lady in your car, you shouldn't immediately follow up your line about owning a gun with a line about being mentally unstable…
Just tryin to bone ain't tryin to have no babies
That's… nice… so, how about those cops?
Laws on patrol and you know they hate me
Okay, so finally we get to the point: police harassing him purely based on the fact that he has a nice car
Twin steady twistin like ""hit this though""
Wait, so your friend is twisting up something that he wants you to take a hit of? Oh… oh…
Police pull up from behind and is in his throat
And when the police pulled up, he swallowed this thing that he wanted you to take a hit of?
Windows down gotta stop pollution
And then, you immediately rolled down the windows, to get rid of the smell this certain thing carried with it?
CDs change, niggas like ""who is that producing?""
Hey, don't change the subject, you are ridin' dirty! Well, I guess he never explicitly said that he WASN'T ridin' dirty, he just said they're trying to catch him ridin' dirty, but to his credit, he never said he was smoking anything while driving either: he said that his friend was about to light something up, and offered it to him, but he never took it. However, of course, if the cops smelled any weed on them at all, it'd be game over for the both of them, a fate that, statistically would be 3 times less likely to happen if they were white. Now, this is a bit of a nuanced criticism I'm going with here, because I'm not saying that if a black dude should be caught doing something illegal, he shouldn't go to jail, far from it; however, I'm saying that a young black male driving a nice car should be held under the same scrutiny by police officers as if he were, say, a late 20's, early 30's upper class white guy in a nice car. By the way, thank you, music video, for that illustration. But yeah, this guy's a young, rich rapper who got where he was by being a talented artist, and if he wants to enjoy the fruits of his success, he shouldn't be profiled because of it!
Got warrants in every city except Houston
Yeah, so what he has a warrant for his arrest in*change tone* every city in American except Houston? Jeez, man! And… what are you doing in Houston that's illegal anywhere else? Well, regardless, look, I understand about racial profiling and all that, but if you've got warrant's in almost every city in America, there's no way it's racial profiling at that point. I'm pretty sure you're just kind of a criminal. Either that, or he needs to stop letting his stoner friends ride passenger. Regardless, that was not a good way to end that verse. I mean, for the most part Cham doesn't directly come off as the stereotype that the police are making him out to be, so I tried to give the guy the benefit of a doubt, but a line like that throws all of it out the window, especially at the tail end there. I don't know, maybe a guest verse from Krayzie Bone could give us a more empathetic character, a guy who's getting hassled by cops, even though he's done nothing wrong
I been drinkin and smokin holy shit cause I really can't focus
Okay… never mind that idea…
I gotta get to home 'fore the po po's scope this
Okay, so… maybe he's drinking and smoking… at the same time… but hey, he might not be hurting anybody!
I gotta get to home 'fore the po po's scope this
Big ol Excursion swerving all up in the curb and...
Oh, on the curb? So, he's driving a Huge car down a… sidewalk…. that's… bad...
Doin a hundred while I puff on the blunt
Oh, driving at 100 miles per hour onto a sidewalk… that is… not better… Yeah, there's no justification for this! You can argue about making weed legal all day, but I think you'll have far fewer supporters for driving 100 miles per hour while drunk and high. Sorry, I'm gonna have to side with the police when it comes to actions that can directly lead to...
*plays car crash at the end of the song*
...well, that. Weird that we're supposed to be rooting for Krayzie Bone in this song as the cool badass when the tail end of the song shows you the exact reason why it's illegal to be impaired behind the wheel of a car!
DAMN! I done spilled my drink…
…precisely!
Yo I gotta hit the back streets
Wanted by the 6 pounds and
I got heat Glock Glock shots to the block we creep creep
Pop Pop hope cops don't see me
Oh, so you're committing murder now? The hell? We don't even know why he's doing it either! There's no justification for this happening, just out of nowhere, he decides, in his intoxicated stupor, that he's going to kill someone
With no regards for the law we dodge em like fuck em all
Okay, how is this song supposed to work again? Because the way the chorus and this verse is coming together, it sounds like they're saying ""Hey! Isn't it stupid how racist cops assume black people to be criminals?"" *guncock*""Let's justify these assumptions!"" Well, maybe something else is going on! Maybe, the idea is that Krayzie Bone is the one who's REALLY the criminal, but since the cops are so busy following Chamillionaire because he has a nice ride, they're letting the REAL criminal get away! Yeah, so Krayzie Bone is committing crimes, while Chamillionaire has nothing to do with--
We bust shots off in the air Krayzie Bone and Chamillionaire
Oh, so they ARE hanging out together. Well, there goes THAT theory
And they upset for sure cause they think they know
That they catchin me with plenty of the drank and dro
Well, if you're hanging out with Krayzie Bone, they will! Sorry, but Krayzie kinda ruined your vibe here. Whereas MAYBE you could excuse the last lyric in the first verse and take at face value the fact that Chamillionaire hadn't explicitly stated that he had done anything illegal, verifying the chorus as a justified chant against corruption in the American legal system, Krayzie Bone negates all of that, and makes it not about the common man mad at corruption in the police department, but about a reckless thug mad at police officers for doing their jobs, and sure, you can have a song about criminal lifestyles and all that, but the smugness and assuredness of that chorus led me to believe you guys were supposed to be the ones in the right in this scenario, being done wrong by the man, but when you're committing criminal acts, obviously out of love for being a criminal, since we have absolutely no reasonings behind your activities beyond ""wow, isn't shooting people and driving over the speed limit cool!?"" yeah, I'm sorry, but that doesn't garner as much empathy
So they get behind me tryin to check my tags, look at my rearview and they smilin
Thinkin they'll catch me on the wrong, they keep tryin
Steady denyin that it's racial profiling
You know, I'd be right there with ya on this if you hadn't mentioned the little part about having warrants in almost every city for your arrest! Call me cynical, but I highly doubt those warrants came from you running into EVERY racist cop in America. Okay, maybe I should let that line go, it was in the first verse, and from the way it was written, it might not have even been originally intended for this song. This is the third verse, and everything's completely different now… I guess…
Glove compartment gotta get my cash
Cause the crooked cops try to come up fast
You know, you could see this as a bad character move on his part, but honestly, hey, he just knows the game: in the case of crooked police, it's not about justice and equality on their end, so Cham might as well play along. And actually, when you think about stuff like parking tickets, speeding tickets, and getting out of jail on bail, the only lesson to really take away from all that is, ""give us enough money, and we'll leave you alone"". So, yeah, it's messed up, but Cham is circumventing wasting time with the system by giving the man what he wants
And been a baller that I am I talk to them, giving a damn bout not feeling my attitude
When they realize I ain't even ridin dirty bet you'll be leavin with an even madder mood
Yeah, take THAT, One time! Your racial prejudice blew up right in your face, giving me a legitimate reason to not take you seriously as an officer. You're an embarrassment to the force, acting on such bigoted, baseless principles! Just… don't look over there at Krayzie Bone, just, just look at me
Well, overall, I'd give this song a 3 out of 5. A LOT of this song is carried on a stellar hook and fun, bouncy production, and both emcees are quite lyrical with their delivery, by the end of the song encapsulating a lot of the distrust that black people in general have against the police. However, the constant deviations from the topic, most of which only serve to brag about getting chicks, being intoxicated and violent, ultimately fulfill the same role that racist cops look for when persecuting black people, and despite it still being drenched with tight wordplay, that fact alone throws out a lot of that goodwill. It's still a better than average song, and attempted to do more than typical mainstream rap song was doing at the time, but unfortunately, it didn't focus on delivering the topic strong enough to rate it higher
Well, I'm the Rap Critic. You don't have to like my opinion, but before you ask, of COURSE I loved the
Weird Al parody
. you'd have to be some kind of moron to not love Weird Al, man…"

I wanna be with you, gotta be with you, need to be with you
I wanna be with you, gotta be with you, need to be with you
I wanna be with you, gotta be with you, need to be with you
I wanna be with you, gotta be with you, need to be with you
I wanna be with you, gotta be with you, need to be with you"

Ain't talking bout no paint shooters
Toting poles longer than Lavillenie
Blasian Baddies what I love, got me goin crazy
Bless her from the back
Going Ham, pulling on her tracks
Mac n Cheese all up in that
Back to back in there
Going through like a running back
Lil D, call me dime, GuwopDrew run that hook back
Call me Doughboy on God making moves boy
Got a bad chick, she foreign too boy
Fuck with my clique on me you get hit boy
Keep talking shit, you just a bitch boy
Bitch boy straps make big noise
Red beam on the shit hitting these licks no broke boy (Kayoe)
Ballin NBA YoungBoy (Paupa got beats making history on God!)
Watts Westcoast shit
Fake niggas counterfeit
Red Rosstein fit
Thats Versace you steppin on!
Versace? You can't spell Versace
Fosachi, F-O sachi!"

Over My Head (Cable Car) Lyrics
I never knew
I never knew that everything was falling through
That everyone I knew was waiting on a cue
To turn and run when all I needed was the truth
But that's how it's gotta be
It's coming down to nothing more than apathy
I'd rather run the other way than stay and see
The smoke and who's still standing when it clears
And everyone knows I'm in
Over my head, over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind, she's on your mind
Let's rearrange
I wish you were a stranger I could disengage
Just say that we agree and then never change
Soften a bit until we all just get along
But that's disregard
You find another friend and you discard
As you lose the argument in a cable car
Hanging above as the canyon comes between
And everyone knows I'm in
Over my head, over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind, she's on your mind
Everyone knows I'm in
Over my head, over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind, she's on, on
And suddenly
I've become a part of your past
I'm becoming the part that don't last
I'm losing you and it's effortless
Without a sound
We lose sight of the ground in the throw around
Never thought that you wanted to bring it down
I won't let it go down 'til we torch it ourselves
And everyone knows I'm in
Over my head, over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind, she's on your mind
Everyone knows
She's on your mind
Everyone knows I'm in over my head
I'm in over my head, I'm over my—
Everyone knows I'm in
Over my head, over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind, she's on your mind"

Without Me Lyrics
The Eminem Show’s lead single shows Eminem’s realization of his importance to the rap game​ and his claim that it wouldn’t be the same without him.

Obie Trice
& Eminem]
Obie Trice, real name, no gimmicks
Ra—
Two trailer-park girls go round the outside
Round the outside, round the outside
Two trailer-park girls go round the outside
Round the outside, round the outside
Woo (Ooh, ooh)
[Refrain: Eminem]
Guess who's back, back again?
Shady's back, tell a friend
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back
(Na-na-na, na, na, na, na, na, na)
(Na-na-na, na, na, na, na)
I've created a monster
'Cause nobody wants to see Marshall no more, they want Shady, I'm chopped liver
Well, if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka that'll jump-start my heart quicker
Than a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
By the doctor when I'm not cooperating
When I'm rockin' the table while he's operating (Hey)
You waited this long, now stop debating
'Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job, Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problem's complicating
So the FCC won't let me be
Or let me be me, so let me see
They tried to shut me down on
MTV
But it feels so empty without me
So come on and dip, bum on your lips
Fuck that, cum on your lips and some on your tits
And get ready, 'cause this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits (Fuck you, Debbie)
Now, this looks like a job for me
So, everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So, everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
Little hellions, kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feelin' like prisoners, helpless
'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells, ""Bitch""
A visionary, vision is scary
Could start a revolution, pollutin' the airwaves
A rebel
,
so just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissin' my ass
And it's a disaster, such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass, you asked for me?
Well, I'm back, da-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na
Fix your bent antenna, tune it in,
and then I'm gonna
Enter in and up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention, back for the winter
I'm interesting,
the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kid's ears and nesting
Testing, ""Attention, please""
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Here's my ten cents, my two cents is free
A nuisance, who sent? You sent for me?
Now, this looks like a job for me
So, everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So, everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
A tisket, a tasket, I'll go tit-for-tat wit'
Anybody who's talkin', ""This shit, that shit""
Chris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards
And Moby? You can get stomped by Obie
You thirty-six-year-old bald-headed fag, blow me
You don't know me, you're too old, let go
It's over, nobody listens to techno
Now, let's go, just give me the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But, sometimes, the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me, I'm just obscene
(Yeah)
Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do Black music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy (Hey)
There's a concept that works
Twenty million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'd be so empty without me
Now, this looks like a job for me
So, everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So, everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

Okay, check it, check it, check it out

I do big-boy things, I make big-boy noise, 'cause
I know what girls want (Want), I know what they like (Like)
They wanna stay up (Ayy!) and party all night
So bring a friend
Let me talk to you, tell you how it is
I was thinking when I saw that body
Gotta get shawty, tell her what the young boy gon' do
Damn, them chicks with you gotta be your kin
Babe, pretty thick with the kick that's sick
That need to be hit, so tell me what y'all gon' do

Mmm, mmm, yeah
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do-do
Ooh, yeah
Gotta change my answering machine
Now that I'm alone
'Cause right now it says that we
Can't come to the phone
And I know it makes no sense
'Cause you walked out the door
But it's the only way I hear your voice anymore
(It's ridiculous)
It's been months
And for some reason I just (Can't get over us)
And I'm stronger than this, yeah (Enough is enough)
No more walking 'round with my head down (Yeah)
I'm so over being blue
Cryin' over you
And I'm so sick of love songs, so tired of tears
So done with wishin' you were still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs, so sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?
Gotta fix that calendar I have
That's marked July 15th
Because since there's no more you
There's no more anniversary
I'm so fed up with my thoughts of you
And your memory
And how every song reminds me of what used to be
That's the reason
I'm so sick of love songs, so tired of tears
So done with wishin' you were still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs, so sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?
(Oh, leave me alone) Leave me alone
(Stupid love songs) Oh-oh, hey
Don't make me think about her smile
Or having my first child
I'm letting go
Turning off the radio
'Cause I'm so sick of love songs (Hey), so tired of tears (So tired of tears)
So done with wishin' she were still here (Oh)
Said I'm so sick of love songs, so sad and slow (Ooh, oh)
So why can't I turn off the radio? (Why can't I turn off the radio?)
And I'm so sick of love songs, so tired of tears (So tired of tears)
So done with wishing she were still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs, so sad and slow (Hey)
Why can't I turn off the radio? (Why can't I turn off the radio?)
And I'm so sick of love songs (So sick of love songs)
So tired of tears (And I'm so sick, so sick of love song)
So done with wishing you were still here

Said I'm so sick of love songs, so sad and slow (Hey)
So why can't I turn off the radio?

(You know, I've never felt like this before) Oh, oh
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la, oh
(This feels, like, so real) Oh, oh
I'm obsessive when just one thought of you comes up
And I'm aggressive, just one thought ain't close enough
You got me stressin', incessantly pressin' the issue
'Cause every moment gone, you know I miss you
I'm the question and you're of course the answer
Just hold me close, boy, 'cause I'm your tiny dancer
You make me shaken, I'm never mistaken
But I can't control myself, got me callin' out for help
S-O-S, please, someone help me
It's not healthy for me to feel this
Y-O-U are makin' this hard
I can't take it, see, it don't feel right
S-O-S, please, someone help me
It's not healthy for me to feel this
Y-O-U are makin' this hard
You got me tossin' and turnin', can't sleep at night
This time, please, someone come and rescue me
'Cause you on my mind, it's got me losin' it
I'm lost, you got me lookin' for the rest of me
Love is testin' me, but still, I'm losin' it
This time, please, someone come and rescue me
'Cause you on my mind, it's got me losin' it
I'm lost, you got me lookin' for the rest of me
Got the best of me, so now I'm losin' it
Just your presence and I second guess my sanity
Yes, it's a lesson, it's unfair, you stole my vanity
My tummy's up in knots and when I see you, it gets so hot
My common sense is out the door, can't seem to find the lock
Take on me (Ah-ha), you know inside you feel it right
Take me on, I could just die up in your arms tonight
I melt with you, you got me head over heels (Over heels)
Boy, you keep me hangin' on, the way you make me feel
S-O-S, please, someone help me
It's not healthy for me to feel this
Y-O-U are makin' this hard (Y-O-U are)
You got me tossin' and turnin', can't sleep at night
This time, please, someone come and rescue me
'Cause you on my mind, it's got me losin' it ('Cause you on my mind)
I'm lost, you got me lookin' for the rest of me
Love is testin' me, but still, I'm losin' it
This time, please, someone come and rescue me (Someone come and rescue me, yeah)
'Cause you on my mind, it's got me losin' it
I'm lost, you got me lookin' for the rest of me
Got the best of me, so now I'm losin' it
Boy, you know you got me feelin' open
And boy, your love's enough with words unspoken
I said, boy, I'm tellin' you, you got me open
I don't know what to do, it's true
I'm goin' crazy over you, I'm beggin'

Oh, well, imagine as I'm pacing the pews in a church corridor—
And I can't help but to hear, no, I can't help but to hear an exchanging of words
""What a beautiful wedding, what a beautiful wedding"", says a bridesmaid to a waiter
""And, yes, but what a shame, what a shame the poor groom's bride is a whore""
I chimed in with a, ""Haven't you people ever heard of closing a goddamn door?""
No, it's much better to face these kinds of things with a sense of poise and rationality
I chimed in, ""Haven't you people ever heard of closing a goddamn door?""
No, it's much better to face these kinds of things with a sense of—
Oh, well, in fact, well, I'll look at it this way
I mean, technically our marriage is saved
Well, this calls for a toast, so pour the champagne
Oh, well, in fact, well, I'll look at it this way
I mean, technically our marriage is saved
Well, this calls for a toast, so pour the champagne, pour the champagne
I chimed in with a, ""Haven't you people ever heard of closing a goddamn door?""
No, it's much better to face these kinds of things with a sense of poise and rationality

Go ahead as you waste your days with thinking
When you fall, everyone stands
Another day and you've had your fill of sinking
With the life held in your
Hands are shaking cold
These hands are meant to hold
Speak to me
When all you gotta keep is strong
Move along, move along like I know ya do
And even when your hope is gone
Move along, move along just to make it through
Move along
Move along
So a day when you've lost yourself completely
Could be a night when your life ends
Such a heart that will lead you to deceiving
All the pain held in your
Hands are shaking cold
Your hands are mine to hold
Speak to me
When all you gotta keep is strong
Move along, move along like I know ya do
And even when your hope is gone
Move along, move along just to make it through
Move along
(Go on, go on, go on, go on)
When everything is wrong, we move along
(Go on, go on, go on, go on)
When everything is wrong, we move
Along (Along)
Along (Along)
Along (Along)
Along (Along)
When all you gotta keep is strong
Move along, move along like I know you do
And even when your hope is gone
Move along, move along, just to make it through
When all you gotta keep is strong
Move along, move along like I know ya do
And even when your hope is gone
Move along, move along just to make it through
(Just to make it through)
When all you gotta keep is strong
Move along, move along like I know ya do (I know ya do)
And even when your hope is gone
Move along, move along just to make it through
Move along
(Go on, go on, go on, go on)
Right back what is wrong, we move along
(We move along)
(Go on, go on, go on, go on)
Right back what is wrong, we move along (We move along)

Right back what is wrong, we move along (We move along)

Gettin' born in the state of Mississippi
Poppa was a copper and her momma was a hippie
In Alabama, she would swing a hammer
Price you gotta pay when you break the panorama
She never knew that there was anything more than poor
What in the world does your company take me for?
Black bandana, sweet Louisiana
Robbin' a bank in the state of Indiana
She's a runner, rebel and a stunner
On her merry way sayin', ""Baby, what you gonna—?""
Lookin' down the barrel of a hot metal .45
Just another way to survive
California, rest in peace
Simultaneous release
California, show your teeth
She's my priestess, I'm your priest, yeah, yeah
She's a lover, baby and a fighter
Shoulda seen her comin' when it got a little brighter
With a name like Dani California
Day was gonna come when I was gonna mourn ya
A little loaded, she was stealin' another breath
I love my baby to death
California, rest in peace

Too true to say, say, say

One for the now and eleven for the later
Never made it up to Minnesota

Down in the Badlands, she was savin' the best for last
It only hurts when I laugh
Gone too fast

Hot Rap Songs Chart 25th Anniversary: Top 100 Songs Lyrics
Via Billboard
To honor the 25th anniversary of Billboard's Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the tally's top 100 tracks ever
Rap is a victorious genre. Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture
So it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential ""Yo! MTV Raps"" was only a few months old, and acts like
Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation
While rap has evolved, there’s no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboard’s Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the top 100 songs in the tally’s quarter-century history. From Salt-N-Pepa to Macklemore, we've got the genre's past quarter-century covered

I can take the rain on the roof of this empty house
That don't bother me
I can take a few tears now and then and just let 'em out
I’m not afraid to cry every once in a while
Even though goin' on with you gone still upsets me
There are days every now and again I pretend I’m okay
But that’s not what gets me
What hurts the most
Was being so close
And havin' so much to say
And watchin' you walk away
And never knowin’
What could've been
And not seein' that loving you
Is what I was tryin' to do
It’s hard to deal with the pain of losin' you everywhere I go
But I’m doin’ it
It’s hard to force that smile when I see our old friends and I’m alone
Still harder gettin' up, gettin' dressed, livin' with this regret
But I know if I could do it over
I would trade, give away all the words that I saved in my heart (Trade it)
That I left unspoken
What hurts the most
Is being so close
And havin' so much to say (Much to say)
And watchin' you walk away
And never knowin'
What could've been
And not seeing that loving you
Is what I was tryin' to do, oh
Oh, yeah
Woo
What hurts the most
Was being so close
And havin' so much to say (Much to say)
And watchin' you walk away
And never knowin'
What could have been
And not seeing that loving you
Is what I was tryin' to do
Not seeing that loving you

How to Save a Life Lyrics
Step one, you say, ""We need to talk""
He walks, you say, ""Sit down, it's just a talk""
He smiles politely back at you
You stare politely right on through
Some sort of window to your right
As he goes left and you stay right
Between the lines of fear and blame
You begin to wonder why you came
Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life
Let him know that you know best
'Cause after all, you do know best
Try to slip past his defense
Without granting innocence
Lay down a list of what is wrong
The things you've told him all along
Pray to God He hears you
And pray to God He hears you, and
Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life
As he begins to raise his voice
You lower yours and grant him one last choice
Drive until you lose the road
Or break with the ones you've followed
He will do one of two things
He will admit to everything
Or he'll say he's just not the same
And you'll begin to wonder why you came
Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life
Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life
How to save a life
How to save a life
Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life
Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend (Where did I go wrong?)
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night (I would have stayed up)
Had I known how to save a life
How to save a life
How to save a life"

Unfaithful Lyrics
Story of my life, searching for the right
But it keeps avoiding me
Sorrow in my soul 'cause it seems that wrong
Really loves my company
He's more than a man and this is more than love
The reason that the sky is blue
The clouds are rolling in because I'm gone again
And to him, I just can't be true
And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying
I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer
I feel it in the air as I'm doin' my hair
Preparing for another date
A kiss upon my cheek as he reluctantly
Asks if I'm gonna be out late
I say I won't be long, just hanging with the girls
A lie I didn't have to tell
Because we both know where I'm about to go
And we know it very well
'
Cause I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying
I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer
Our love, his trust
I might as well take a gun and put it to his head
Get it over with
I don't wanna do this anymore
Woah, anymore
And I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
And every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
And I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer
A murderer, no, no, no
Yeah, yeah"

Would you lie with me and just forget the world?
Forget what we're told
Before we get too old
Show me a garden that's burstin' into life
Let's waste time
Chasin' cars
Around our heads
I need your grace
To remind me
To find my own
If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?
Forget what we're told
Before we get too old
Show me a garden that's burstin' into life
All that I am
All that I ever was
Is here in your perfect eyes, they're all I can see
I don't know where
Confused about how, as well
Just know that these things will never change for us at all
If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?"

Honey, why you callin' me so late?
It’s kinda hard to talk right now
Honey, why you cryin'? Is everything okay?
I gotta whisper 'cause I can't be too loud
Oh, well, my girl's in the next room
Sometimes I wish she was you
I guess we never really moved on
It’s really good to hear your voice
Sayin' my name, it sounds so sweet
Comin' from the lips of an angel
Hearin' those words, it makes me weak
And I never wanna say goodbye
But girl, you make it hard to be faithful
With the lips of an angel
It‘s funny that you're callin' me tonight
And yes, I've dreamt of you too
Does he know you're talkin' to me
Will it start a fight?
No, I don't think she has a clue
Oh, well, my girl's in the next room
Sometimes I wish she was you
I guess we never really moved on
It’s really good to hear your voice
Sayin' my name, it sounds so sweet
Comin' from the lips of an angel
Hearin' those words, it makes me weak
And I never wanna say goodbye
But girl, you make it hard to be faithful
With the lips of an angel
[Guitar Solo]
It's really good to hear your voice
Sayin' my name, it sounds so sweet
Comin' from the lips of an angel
Hearin' those words, it makes me weak
And I never wanna say goodbye
But girl, you make it hard to be faithful
With the lips of an angel
(Never wanna say goodbye)
But girl, you make it hard to be faithful
With the lips of an angel
Honey, why you callin' me so late?"

I still hear your voice when you sleep next to me
I still feel your touch in my dream (In my dream)
Forgive me my weakness, but I don't know why
Without you, it's hard to survive
'Cause every time we touch, I get this feeling
And every time we kiss, I swear I could fly
Can't you feel my heart beat fast? I want this to last
Need you by my side
'Cause every time we touch, I feel the static
And every time we kiss, I reach for the sky
Can't you hear my heart beat so? I can't let you go
Want you in my life
[Drop]
Your arms are my castle, your heart is my sky
They wipe away tears that I cry (That I cry)
The good and the bad times, we've been through them all
You make me rise when I fall
'Cause every time we touch, I get this feeling
And every time we kiss, I swear I could fly
Can't you feel my heart beat fast? I want this to last
Need you by my side
'Cause every time we touch, I feel the static
And every time we kiss, I reach for the sky
Can't you hear my heart beat so? I can't let you go
Want you in my life

Ain’t No Other Man Lyrics
Hey, yeah
(
Do your thang, honey
)
I could feel it from the start
Couldn't stand to be apart
Somethin' 'bout you caught my eye
Somethin' moved me deep inside, yeah
I don't know what you did, boy, but you had it
And I've been hooked ever since
I told my mother, my brother
My sister and my friends
Told the others (Others), my lovers (Lovers)
Both past and present tense (Alright)
That every time I see you, everything starts making sense
(
Do your thang, honey
)
Ain't no other man can stand up next to you
Ain't no other man on the planet does what you do (What you do)
You're the kind of guy, a girl finds in a blue moon (Hey)
You got soul (Hey), you got class (Ooh), you got style, you're badass (Oh yeah)
Ain't no other man, it's true (Alright)
Ain't no other man but you
Never thought I'd be alright (No, no, no)
'Till you came and changed my life (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
What was cloudy now is clear, yeah, yeah
You're the light that I need here, yeah
You got what I want boy, and I want it
So keep on giving it up
So tell your mother (Mother), your brother (Brother)
Your sister and your friends (Your sister and your friends)
Tell the others (Others), your lovers (Lovers)
Better not be present tense (Uh-huh)
'Cause I want everyone to know that you are mine and no one else's
Whoa, whoa, oh, oh
Ain't no other man can stand up next to you (To you, babe)
Ain't no other man (Ain't no other man, no) on the planet does what you do (Do)
You're the kind of guy a girl finds (A girl finds) in a blue moon (Hey)
You got soul (Soul), you got class (Class)
You got style (Uh), you're badass (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Ain't no other man it's true
Ain't no other man but you
(
Break it down now

Ain't no other, ain't, ain't no other, other
Ain't no other, ain't, ain't no other lover (Ooh-woo)
Ain't no other, I, I, I need no other
Ain't no other man but you, oh
You are there when I'm a mess
You talked me down from every ledge
Give me strength, boy, you're the best
You're the only one who's ever passed every test
Ain't no other man (Woo) can stand (Yeah) up next to you (Next to you, no, hey, yeah, alright)
Ain't no other man on the planet does what you do (Ooh, eh)
You're the kind of guy a girl finds in a blue moon (You're the kind of guy a girl will find)
You got soul (Yeah), you got class (Yeah)
You got style (Oh), you're badass (Oh yeah)

She says she's no good
With words, but I'm worse
Barely stuttered out a joke of a romantic
Stuck to my tongue
Weighed down with words too
Overdramatic
Tonight, it's ""it can't get much worse""
Versus ""No one should ever feel like...""
I'm two quarters and a heart down
And I don't want to forget how your voice sounds
These words are all I have so I write them
So you need them just to get by

Dance, dance, and these are the lives you love to lead
Dance, this is the way they'd love
If they knew how misery loved me
You always fold just
Before you're found out
Drink up, it's last call, last resort
But only the first mistake, and I
I'm two quarters and a heart down
And I don't want to forget how your voice sounds
These words are all I have so I write them
So you need them just to get by
Why don't you show me the little bit of spine
You've been saving for his mattress (love)

Dance, this is the way they'd love
If they knew how misery loved me
Why don't you show me the little bit of spine
You've been saving for his mattress (Mattress, mattress)
I only want sympathy in the form of you
Crawling into bed with me
Dance, dance, we're falling apart to half-time

Bone Digger Lyrics
== Bone Digger ==
Parody of ""Gold Digger"" by Kanye West (Featuring Jamie Foxx)
(Romans 1:18-25, Job 40:15-41:34)
They make a monkey right out of me -- Yes, they've been tryin' endlessly
Overeager bonediggers -- they never found that jigsaw piece
They make a monkey right out of me -- It makes for funky biology
I'm not the kid of some hominid, who comes from a lizard, whose mama was a fish
Now I ain't hatin' on the bone diggers, but I say evolution don't figure
Now, I ain't hatin' on the bone diggers, but I ain't never seen no holes bigger
It sounds like no evidence found, it sounds like their heads in the ground
It sounds like they're just too proud, it sounds quite boneheaded
You need to ponder whether evolution is wrong
Whether maybe you was put on under cover of dawn
They said, ""We can tell from rocks, we tell by the carbon""
'Cause this world has gotta flock of descendants of Charles Robert Darwin
But I'm lookin' for the odds at casinos
That life could come to be from random acids amino
Zero -- we know it's hocus pocus
And they wanna make all of that an accidental process?
O.K., let's pretend a fishy got some kids
That stood up on their fins and crawled up on land
Without evidence and here we are today
If you're trustin' in this worldview you better have faith
You know why? They make too much of nothin'
Stuff that I've heard it should have been on Mythbusters
Their best forensic samples couldn't cut the mustard
You don't care what none of us say you still trust it
(They make a monkey) Now I ain't hatin' on the bone diggers (right out of me)
But I say evolution don't figure (It makes for funky)
Now, I ain't hatin' on the bone diggers (biology)
But I ain't never seen no holes bigger (I'm not the kid)
It sounds like no evidence found (of some hominid)
It sounds like their heads in the ground (who comes from a lizard)
It sounds like they're just too proud (whose mama was a fish)
It sounds quite boneheaded
1859's the fateful year -- they've had 150 years to prove their great new theory
I know some funny ways they found support for some of it, kids
They made some hominids from parts of gibbons and pigs
Your museums are deceiving when you visit one they
Take a couple bones pawn it off as a primate
They were s'posed to find all sorts of life forms we could study
They went to the rocks and got dinosaurs in the muddy
They're talkin' down actin' like the Bible is so funny
Could've got dinos sooner if they tried Job 41-y
If it ain't no bunk, holler ""We want proof now, we want proof now, yeah!""
It's somethin' that'll make you mad
Cause all the links they had were either weak or bad
Great big digs since the 1860's
And after waiting and searchin' they found out it doesn't exist?
CHORUS
Now I ain't hating on the bone digger, no, not me
I've found trilobites in stone and some petrified trees
You know evolution ain't paleontology
Transition forms are lackin' -- got a hole up his sleeve
But -- the other option's not fun
So he gonna make you into a man out of that pond scum
This is his religion baby, don't be surprised
That fishy on all fours on his jeep's his messiah
So, let's no fight -- I won't abuse Darwin 'cause that's not nice
And they're gonna keep stallin' and tryin' to prove they're right though
And when you catch on we'll lead you back to the Bible
SECOND HALF OF CHORUS
Romans 1:18-20
The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of men who suppress the truth by their wickedness, since what may be known about God is plain to them, because God has made it plain to them. For since the creation of the world God's invisible qualities—his eternal power and divine nature—have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that men are without excuse

Hot Rap Songs Chart 25th Anniversary: Top 100 Songs Lyrics
Via Billboard
To honor the 25th anniversary of Billboard's Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the tally's top 100 tracks ever
Rap is a victorious genre. Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture
So it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential ""Yo! MTV Raps"" was only a few months old, and acts like
Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation
While rap has evolved, there’s no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboard’s Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the top 100 songs in the tally’s quarter-century history. From Salt-N-Pepa to Macklemore, we've got the genre's past quarter-century covered

Photograph Lyrics
“Photograph” is a rock song recorded by Canadian rock band Nickelback, released as the lead single from their fifth studio album, All the Right Reasons.
Lyrically, the song follows the narrator reminiscing…
Read More
Look at this photograph
Every time I do, it makes me laugh
How did our eyes get so red?
And what the hell is on Joey's head?
And this is where I grew up
I think the present owner fixed it up
I never knew we ever went without
The second floor is hard for sneaking out
And this is where I went to school
Most of the time had better things to do
Criminal record says I broke in twice
I must've done it half a dozen times
I wonder if it's too late
Should I go back and try to graduate?
Life's better now than it was back then
If I was them, I wouldn't let me in
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, God, I, I
Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
(Goodbye)
Remember the old arcade?
Blew every dollar that we ever made
The cops hated us hangin' out
They say somebody went and burned it down
We used to listen to the radio
And sing along with every song we know
We said someday we'd find out how it feels
To sing to more than just the steering wheel
Kim's the first girl I kissed
I was so nervous that I nearly missed
She's had a couple of kids since then
I haven't seen her since God knows when
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, God, I, I
Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
I miss that town
I miss their faces
You can't erase
You can't replace it
I miss it now
I can't believe it
So hard to stay
Too hard to leave it
If I could relive those days
I know the one thing that would never change
Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
Look at this photograph
Every time I do, it makes me laugh
Every time I do, it makes me"

Because of You Lyrics
Ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh
I will not make the same mistakes that you did
I will not let myself cause my heart so much misery
I will not break the way you did, you fell so hard
I've learned the hard way to never let it get that far
Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you, I am afraid
I lose my way
And it's not too long before you point it out
I cannot cry
Because I know that's weakness in your eyes
I'm forced to fake a smile, a laugh, every day of my life
My heart can't possibly break
When it wasn't even whole to start with
Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid
I watched you die, I heard you cry every night in your sleep
(
I watched you die, in your sleep
)
I was so young, you should have known better than to lean on me
(
I was too young for you to lean on me
)
You never thought of anyone else, you just saw your pain
(
You never saw me, yeah, yeah
)
And now I cry in the middle of the night
For the same damn thing
Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I try my hardest just to forget everything
Because of you
I don't know how to let anyone else in
Because of you
I'm ashamed of my life because it's empty
Because of you
I am afraid
Because of you (Ah-ah, ah, ah)
Because of you, mmh, ooh"

Goddamn, little mama
You know you thick as hell, know what I'm sayin?
Matter fact, after the club, you know what I'm talkin' 'bout

I'm in love with a stripper
She's every man's dream, she's God's gift to Earth
Women they love 'em too, that's what you call a woman's worth
See I love all the strippers, because they show me love
They know I never pay, it's free whenever I hit the club
But I can't even lie, the girls are here so fly
She slidin' up and down that pole, got me mesmerized
Mike Jones don't ever trick, but goddamn she thick
I can't lie, I must admit

Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone
She said, ""Some days, I feel like shit
Some days, I wanna quit and just be normal for a bit""
I don't understand why you have to always be gone
I get along, but the trips always feel so long
And I find myself tryin' to stay by the phone
'Cause your voice always helps me to not feel so alone
But I feel like an idiot working my day around a call
But when I pick up, I don't have much to say
So I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waiting, at times debating
Telling you that I've had it with you and your career
Me and the rest of the family here singing, ""Where'd you go?""
Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone
Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone
Please come back home
Come back home, you know, the place where you used to live
Used to barbeque up burgers and ribs
Used to have a little party every Halloween with candy by the pile
But, now, you only stop by every once in a while
Shit, I find myself just filling my time
With anything to keep the thought of you from my mind
I'm doing fine and I'm planning to keep it that way
And you can call me if you find that you have something to say
And I'll tell you I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waiting, at times debating
Telling you that I've had it with you and your career
Me and the rest of the family here singing, ""Where'd you go?""
Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone
Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone
Please come back home
I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waiting, no longer debating
Tired of sitting and hating and making these excuses
For why you're not around and feeling so useless
It seems one thing has been true all along
You don't really know what you got 'til it's gone
I guess I've had it with you and your career
When you come back, I won't be here and you can sing it
Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone
Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone
Please come back home
Please come back home
Please come back home
Please come back home
Please come back home

Yo (Excuse Me Miss) Lyrics
Woah, woah
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Yeah, uh-huh, yeah
Yo, tell me fellas have you seen her? (Seen her)
It was about five minutes ago
When I seen the hottest chick that a youngin' ever seen before
I say, ""Yo, tell the girls I wanna meet her"" (Meet her)
On second thought that ain't the way to go
I gotta give her game proper
Spit it so she'll get it, there she is, I gotta stop her
Oh, should I talk about her smile? (It's been said before)
Or what about her style? (Too obvious)
I'm out of time, she's out the door
I gotta go for mine, I think I'll say
Yo
I don't know your name but excuse me, miss (Oh yeah)
I saw you from across the room
And I gotta admit that you got my attention
You're making me wanna say yo
I know you're tryna leave but excuse me, miss
I saved the last dance for you
I would love to keep you here with me, oh baby
Now shawty, grab hold of my hand
And let's pretend the floor is ours
You say you don't really dance
(Don't worry 'bout it, we just one-two step, one-two step)
Now if the music is movin' too fast (Too fast)
Grab my hand a little tighter (Tighter)
Don't be afraid to move a little closer
Girl, there's somethin' about you that makes me wanna say (Aw yeah, aw yeah)
Yo
I don't know your name but excuse me, miss (Ooh)
I saw you from across the room
And I gotta admit that you got my attention
You're making me wanna say yo
I know you're tryna leave but excuse me, miss (Ooh)
I saved the last dance for you
I would love to keep you here with me, oh baby
I think I'll say yo
I don't know your name but excuse me, miss
I saw you from across the room
And I gotta admit that you got my attention
You're making me wanna say yo
I know you're tryna leave but excuse me, miss
I saved the last dance for you
I would love to keep you here with me, oh baby
I wanna be where you are
Ain't nothin' wrong with dancin'
Baby, you're so romantic
Baby, I can be in your heart
So many things I wanna tell you
I think that I should start by sayin'
Yo, woah
I don't know your name but excuse me, miss (Oh yeah)
I saw you from across the room
I gotta give her game proper
Spit it so she'll get it, there she is I gotta stop her (Oh yeah)
I know you're tryna leave but excuse me, miss (Oh)
I saved the last dance for you
I would love to keep you here with me, oh baby
Now everybody just clap your hands like this (Like this)
Just clap your hands like this (Woah, like this, huh)
And if your shorty's in the house tonight
Just grab her by the hand, homie, make her understand
Y'all was made to dance like this (Like this)
Y'all was made to bounce like this (Woah, like this)
Just let her know she was made for you and
You wanna do everything she want to, man
Ha, woo!"

You've got your mother and your brother
Every other undercover telling you what to say (What to say)
You think I'm stupid, but the truth is that it's cupid, baby
Lovin' you has made me this way
So before you point your finger
Get your hands off of my trigger
Oh, yeah
You need to know this situation's getting old
And now the more you talk, the less I can take, oh
I'm looking for attention, not another question
Should you stay or should you go?
Well, if you don't have the answer
Why you still standin' here?
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Just walk away
Just walk away
Just walk away
I waited here for you like a kid waiting after school
So tell me, how come you never showed? (Never showed)
I gave you everything and never asked for anything
And look at me, I'm all alone (Alone)
So, before you start defending
Baby, stop all your pretending
I know you know I know
So what's the point in being slow?
Let's get the show on the road today
Hey!
I'm looking for attention, not another question
Should you stay or should you go?
Well, if you don't have the answer
Why you still standin' here?
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Just walk away
Just walk away
Just walk away
I wanna love, I wanna fire
To feel the burn, my desires
I want a man by my side
Not a boy who runs and hides
Are you gonna fight for me? Die for me?
Live and breathe for me? Do you care for me?
'Cause if you don't, then boy, just leave
I'm looking for attention, not another question
Should you stay or should you go?
Well, if you don't have the answer
Why you still standin' here?
Hey, hey, hey, hey (Walk away)
Just walk away
If you don't have the answer (Walk away)
Just walk (Walk) away (Just walk away)
Then just leave
Yeah, yeah

Dirty Little Secret Lyrics
Let me know that I've done wrong
When I've known this all along
I go around a time or two
Just to waste my time with you
Tell me all that you've thrown away
Find out games you don't wanna play
You are the only one
That needs to know
I'll keep you my dirty little secret (Dirty little secret)
Don't tell anyone or you'll be just another regret
(Just another regret, hope that you can keep it)
My dirty little secret, who has to know?
When we live such fragile lives
It's the best way we survive
I go around a time or two
Just to waste my time with you
Tell me all that you've thrown away
Find out games you don't wanna play
You are the only one
That needs to know
I'll keep you my dirty little secret (Dirty little secret)
Don't tell anyone or you'll be just another regret
(Just another regret, hope that you can keep it)
My dirty little secret, who has to know?
The way she feels inside (Inside)
Those thoughts I can't deny (Deny)
These sleeping dogs won't lie (Won't lie)
And all I've tried to hide
It's eating me apart
Trace this line back
[Interlude]
I'll keep you my dirty little secret (Dirty little secret)
Don't tell anyone or you'll be just another regret
(Just another regret)
I'll keep you my dirty little secret (Dirty little secret)
Don't tell anyone or you'll be just another regret
(Just another regret, hope that you can keep it)
My dirty little secret, dirty little secret
Dirty little secret, who has to know? Who has to know?"

Savin’ Me Lyrics
Prison gates won't open up for me
On these hands and knees, I'm crawlin'
Oh, I reach for you
Well, I'm terrified of these four walls
These iron bars can't hold my soul in
All I need is you (Come, please, I'm callin')
And oh, I scream for you (Hurry, I'm fallin', I'm fallin')
Show me what it's like (To be the last one standing)
And teach me wrong from right (And I'll show you what I can be)
And say it for me, say it to me
And I'll leave this life behind me
Say it if it's worth savin' me
Heaven's gates won't open up for me
With these broken wings I'm fallin'
All I see is you
These city walls ain't got no love for me
I'm on the ledge of the eighteenth story
And oh, I scream for you (Come, please, I'm callin')
And all I need from you (Hurry, I'm fallin', I'm fallin')
Show me what it's like (To be the last one standing)
And teach me wrong from right (And I'll show you what I can be)
And say it for me, say it to me
And I'll leave this life behind me
Say it if it's worth savin' me
Hurry, I'm fallin' (Hey, yeah)
And all I need is you (Come, please, I'm callin')
And oh, I scream for you (Hurry, I'm fallin', I'm fallin', I'm fallin')
Show me what it's like (To be the last one standing)
And teach me wrong from right (And I'll show you what I can be)
And say it for me, say it to me
And I'll leave this life behind me
Say it if it's worth savin' me (Hurry, I'm fallin')
And say it for me, say it to me
And I'll leave this life behind me
Say it if it's worth savin' me"

Don’t Forget About Us Lyrics
Jermaine Dupri
]
(Don't forget about us)
Don't baby, don't baby, don't let it go
No baby, no baby, no baby, no
(Don't forget about us)
Don't baby, don't baby, don't let it go
My baby (
Y'all know what this is
) boy
Just let it die with no goodbyes
Details don't matter, we both paid the price
Tears in my eyes
You know sometimes it'd be like that, baby
(Ah) Now every time I see you, I pretend I'm fine
When I wanna reach out to you
But I turn and I walk and I let it ride
Baby, I must confess
We were bigger than anything
Remember us at our best
And don't forget about
(Don’t, baby, don’t, baby, don’t, baby, don’t)
Late nights, playing in the dark
And waking up inside my arms
Boy, you'll always be in my heart and
I can see it in your eyes, you still want it
So don't forget about us
I'm just speaking from experience
Nothing can compare to your first true love
So I hope this will remind you
When it's for real, it's forever
So don't forget about us
Oh, they say that you're in a new relationship
But we both know nothing comes close to
What we had, it perseveres
That we both can't forget it
How good we used to get it
There's only one me and you
And how we used to shine (We used to shine)
No matter who you go through
We are one, that's a fact that you can't deny
So, baby, we just can't let the fire pass us by
Forever we'd both regret
So don't forget about
Late nights, playing in the dark
And waking up inside my arms
Boy, you'll always be in my heart and
I can see it in your eyes, you still want it
So don't forget about us
I'm just speaking from experience
Nothing can compare to your first true love
So I hope this will remind you
When it's for real, it's forever
So don't forget about us
Apparently she got your head all messed up
Now that's the trickery
'Cause you want her to act like you know how this lovin' used to be, uh
I bet she can't do it like me
She'll never be MC
Baby, don't you, don't you forget about us
Late nights, playing in the dark
And waking up inside my arms (About us)
Boy, you'll always be in my heart and
I can see it in your eyes, you still want it
So don't forget about us (About us) (Oh babe)
I'm just speaking from experience
Nothing can compare to your first true love (About us)
So I hope this will remind you
When it's for real, it's forever
So don't forget about us
Late nights, playing in the dark
And waking up inside my arms
Boy, you'll always be in my heart and
I can see it in your eyes, you still want it
So don't forget about us (About us)
I'm just speaking from experience
Nothing can compare to your first true love (About us)
So I hope this will remind you, babe
When it's for real, it's forever
So don't forget about us (About us)
Don't baby, don't baby, don't let it go
No baby, no baby, no baby, no (Don't forget about us)
Don't baby, don't baby, don't let it go
When it's for real, it's forever
So don't forget about us"

My sexy love
So sexy
She makes the hairs on the back of my neck stand up
Just one touch
And I erupt like a volcano and cover her with my love
Baby girl, you make me say
And I just can't think (Of anything else I'd rather do)
Than to hear you sing (Sing my name the way you do)
When we do our thing (When we do the things we do)
Baby girl, you make me say
Sexy love
Girl, the things you do (Oh baby, baby)
Keep me sprung
Keep me running back to you
Oh, I love making love to you
Baby girl, you know you're my (Sexy love)
I'm so addicted to her
She's the sweetest drug
Just enough
Still too much say that I'm simping
And I'm sprung all of the above
I can't help she makes me say
And I just can't think (Of anything else I'd rather do)
Than to hear you sing (Sing my name the way you do)
When we do our thing (When we do the things we do)
Baby girl, you make me say
Sexy love
Girl, the things you do
(Oh baby baby)
Keep me sprung
Keep me running back to you
Oh, I love making love to you
Baby girl, you know you're my (Sexy love)
Oh, baby what we do
It makes the sun come up
Keep on lovin' 'til it goes back down
And I don't know what I'd do
If I would lose your touch
That's why I'm always keeping you around
My sexy love
Sexy love
Girl, the things you do
(Oh baby, baby)
Keep me sprung, keep me running back to you
Oh, I love making love to you
Baby girl you know you're my (Sexy love)
Sexy love
Girl, the things you do
(Oh baby, baby)
Keep me sprung
Keep me running back to you
Oh, I love making love to you
Baby girl, you know you're my (Sexy love)
She makes the hairs on the back of my neck stand up
Just one touch"

Tryna chase me through the club for this good shit
But I don't think you can handle this pussy
What'cha gon' do with this pussy, boy?
You lookin' like you got that good gooshy gooshy
Fuck around with me, I'll beat the brakes off that pussy
Have yo' ass comin' like a porno star movie
Tell yo' friends, then I'll bet they all wanna do me
Hoes know me, I'm E-four-O
They recognized pimpin' when I stepped in the door
Higher than a satellite, full of that 'dro
Holla at a player when you're ready to go, ooh

This time, this place
Misused, mistakes
Too long, too late
Who was I to make you wait?
Just one chance, just one breath
Just in case there's just one left
'Cause you know
You know, you know
I love you
I loved you all along
And I miss you
Been far away for far too long
I keep dreaming you'll be with me
And you'll never go
Stop breathing
If I don't see you anymore
On my knees, I'll ask
Last chance for one last dance
'Cause with you, I'd withstand
All of Hell to hold your hand
I'd give it all, I'd give for us
Give anything, but I won't give up
'Cause you know
You know, you know
I love you
I loved you all along
And I miss you
Been far away for far too long
I keep dreaming you'll be with me
And you'll never go
Stop breathing
If I don't see you anymore
So far away (So far away)
Been far away for far too long
So far away (So far away)
Been far away for far too long
But you know
You know, you know
I wanted
I wanted you to stay
'Cause I needed
I need to hear you say
That I love you (I love you)
I loved you all along
And I forgive you (I forgive you)
For being away for far too long
So keep breathing
'Cause I'm not leaving you anymore
Believe it
Hold on to me, and never let me go
Keep breathing
'Cause I'm not leaving you anymore
Believe it
Hold on to me, never let me go
Keep breathing
Hold on to me, never let me go
Keep breathing
Hold on to me, never let me go"

What’s Left of Me Lyrics
Watch my life pass me by
In the rear view mirror
Pictures frozen in time, are becoming clearer
I don't wanna waste another day
Stuck in the shadow of my mistakes
Yeah
'Cause I want you, and I feel you
Crawling underneath my skin
Like a hunger, like a burning
To find a place I've never been
Now I'm broken, and I'm fading
I'm half the man I thought I would be
But you can have what's left of me
I've been dying inside
Little by little
Nowhere to go, but going out of my mind
In endless circles
Running from myself until
You gave me a reason for standing still
And I want you, and I feel you
Crawling underneath my skin
Like a hunger, like a burning
To find a place I've never been
Now I'm broken, and I'm fading
I'm half the man I thought I would be
But you can have what's left of me
Falling faster, barely breathing
Give me something
to believe in
Tell me it's not all in my head
Take what's left of this man
Make me whole, once again
'Cause I want you, and I feel you
Crawling underneath my skin
Like a hunger, like a burning
To find a place I've never been
Now I'm broken, and I'm fading
I'm half the man I thought I would be
You can have all that's left
Yeah, yeah, yeah
What's left of me
Oh, oh, oh-oh
I've been dying inside, you see
I'm going out of my mind, out of my mind
I'm just running in circles all the time
Will you take what's left?
Will you take what's left?
Will you take what's left of me?
Just running in circles in my mind
Will you take what's left?
Will you take what's left?
Will you take what's left of me?
Take what's left of me"

So What Lyrics
Ladies and gentlemen!
Jazze Pha, Field Mob, Ciara
Superstar DJ's, here we go
They say - ""He do a little this, he do a little that
He always in trouble,"" and I heard
""He's nuttin' but a pimp, he's done a lot of chicks
He's always in the club,"" and they say
""He think he slick, he's got a lot of chips
He's sellin' them drugs,"" and I heard
""He's been locked up, find somebody else
He ain't nuttin' but a thug""
So whaaaaaaaaat, so whaaaaaat
So whaaaaaat, so whaaaaat
And they say - I'm a slut, I'm a ho, I'm a freak
I got a different girl every day of the week
You too smart, you'd be a dummy to believe
That stuff that you heard that they say about me
They say that I'm this, they say that I'm that
But all of it's fiction, none of it's fact
But you don't be hearin' it about your lover
You let it go in one ear and out the other
Now he say, she say, they say, I heard
If they fake, we can't let it get on our nerves
She miserable, she just want you to be
Like her, misery needs company
So don't listen to that vine of grapes - They're
Nuttin' but liars hatin', and I bet
They wouldn't mind tradin' pla-ces
With you by my side in my Mercedes
They say - ""He do a little this, he do a little that
He always in trouble,"" and I heard
""He's nuttin' but a pimp, he's done a lot of chicks
He's always in the club,"" and they say
""He think he slick, he's got a lot of chips
He's sellin' them drugs,"" and I heard
""He's been locked up, find somebody else
He ain't nuttin' but a thug""
So whaaaaaaaaat, so whaaaaaat
So whaaaaaat, so whaaaaat
Mo' Money, Mo' Problems, life of a legend
Haters throw salt like rice at a weddin
So what, that's your cousin, they don't mean nuthin'
Her like missin' a type of affection you get
You just blind to the facts
See the lies just as obvious as cries for attention
Fuel to the fire, that supplies your suspicion
But listen, say you love me, gotta trust me
Why you stress this high school mess?
Break up never, they just jealous!
Drama from your momma, mean mug from your brothers
I'm that author of the book, they can judge from the cover
Yes - I, I been to jail
And yes - I'm grindin' for real
I'm a positive-talkin' negative pimp
They hate to see you doin' better than them, so!
They say - ""He do a little this, he do a little that
He always in trouble,"" and I heard
""He's nuttin' but a pimp, he's done a lot of chicks
He's always in the club,"" and they say
""He think he slick, he's got a lot of chips
He's sellin' them drugs,"" and I heard
""He's been locked up, find somebody else
He ain't nuttin' but a thug""
So whaaaaaaaaat, so whaaaaaat
So whaaaaaat, so whaaaaat

""He think he slick, he's got a lot of chips
He's sellin' them drugs,"" and I heard
""He's been locked up, find somebody else
He ain't nuttin' but a thug""

(Woohoo, woohoo)
(Woohoo, woohoo)
Well, my heart knows me better than I know myself
So I'm gonna let it do all the talking
(Woohoo, woohoo)
I came across a place in the middle of nowhere
With a big black horse and a cherry tree
(Woohoo, woohoo)
I felt a little fear upon my back
I said, ""Don't look back, just keep on walking""
(Woohoo, woohoo)
Well, the big black horse said, ""Look this way""
He said, ""Hey lil' lady, will you marry me?""
But I said, ""No no, no no no no""
I said, ""No no""
You're not the one for me""
No no, no no no no
I said, ""No no, you're not the one for me
Ooh, woohoo
And my heart had a problem in the early hours
So I stopped it dead for a beat or two
(Woohoo, woohoo)
But I cut some cord and I shouldn't have done it
And it won't forgive me after all these years
(Woohoo, woohoo)
So I sent her to a place in the middle of nowhere
With a big black horse and a cherry tree
(Woohoo, woohoo)
Now it won't come back cause it's oh so happy
And now I've got a hole for the world to see, yeah
(Woohoo, woohoo)
And it said, ""No no, no no no no
I said, ""No no
You're not the one for me""
No no, no no no no
I said, ""No no, you're not the one for me""
Ooh, woohoo
(Not the one for me, yeah)
(Woohoo)
I said, ""No no no no, no no no
No, no
You're not the one for me"" (Woohoo)
No no no no
No no
No no, you're not the one for me""
(Woohoo)
Big black horse and a cherry tree
(No no, no no no no)
I can't quite get there
'Cause my heart's forsaken me
Yeah, yeah, yeah (No no)

I can't quite get there cause my heart's forsaken me"

Who want it with me? Nobody want it with me
Oh, I'm so fly, oh, mami, come and get me
Sit it down, back up, bring it on, back up

There it go, if you want it, come and get it

So girl, let me see you get low
There it go, yeah, just like that

So take off them clothes and get undressed, girl

Two Tone Rebel Lyrics
Hop to it with the fluids
Study like a student who be fucking with them truants
(I never left!)
No pack but I still smell sewage
Catch me blowing on that loud like a motherfucking tuba (Like a motherfuckin' tuba!)
Like it's motherfucking Zumba
Robot drop top cut-throat mula (Cut-throat mula)
Hopped out that Uber
Brand-brand new shoes no newer
(No newer)
Don't fuck with me I got that Two Tone Rebel shit stuck to me, uh!
And it's a luxury, fucking with these beats got me living comfortably, uh! (Comfortably!)
And what I provide is the soundtrack that proves that we went through this life
Never divide, always survive
(Okay folks, we have arrived)
Yeah, jazzers on deck when I come through
No Five-O on my gumshoe
We got more kicks than a kung-fu
Flick fuckboy might get it when he come to
But he don't seem like he'll be waking up
Most slept on him, fuck it, cousin, show me love
Two-one-fifth
in my veins don't get it fucked
Run up on me wrong, I won't even fuck a knuckle up
Roughly about the size of Shaq
, I fire back
I fire first, the damage hurts
The chorus hits,
the drums are sick
Got kids out in Dubai bangin' my old shit
The dude is home
The wheels are clean
The flow is mean
I been E-dubble since the days of between
And god damn,
(What?)
I'm about the Shoulder Lean
Like Young Dro and T.I
Ya, (Lock and loaded) ya
Drama, they like me
(Uh)
Full-size don't psych me
(Uh)
Pull up on eighteens and, yeah, they just like me
(Ay)
V8 all in mine, my wheels and my rims shine
R/T go hard G, no question with wind chimes
Front for that sponsor, front for that front doe'
If they can each time, my horse would be front row
Fuck what they came for, I know what they came for
My name is E-Dubble and I am not made
Fuck plan B, I got a plan for it
I put my head down and I just ran for it
Couldn't see the pitfalls that I ran towards
Moving so fast I was coming out my airforce
Keep the shoes on, get your move on
Stop slippin', you been trippin' way too long
Both shoes on, new true song
Rings a bell? Well, it must be Two Tones, uh!
Jazzers on deck when I come through
No Five-O on my gumshoe
We got more kicks than a kung-fu
Flick fuckboy might get it when he come to
But he don't seem like he'll be waking up-waking up
Most slept on him, fuck it, cousin, show me love-show me love
Two-one-fifth
in my veins don't get it fucked
Run up on me wrong, I won't
(Lock and loaded)
Jazzers on deck when I come through

Justin Timberlake - My Love ft. T.I. (Tradução em Português) Lyrics
Não existe outra mulher que poderia tomar o seu lugar, meu—
[Verso 1: Justin Timberlake]
Se eu te escrevesse uma sinfonia
Só para dizer o quanto você significa para mim (O que você faria?)
Se eu dissesse que você é linda
Você sairia comigo regularmente? (Me diga, você sairia?)
Bem, baby, eu estive ao redor do mundo
Mas eu não me vi outra garota (Como você)
Esse anel aqui representa o meu coração
Mas há apenas uma coisa que eu preciso dе você (Diga ""Eu aceito"")
Porque
[Refrão: Justin Timberlake e
Timbaland
]
Eu consigo ver a gеnte de mãos dadas
Caminhando na praia, nossos pés na areia
Eu posso ver a gente no campo
Sentados na grama, deitados lado a lado
Você pode ser o meu amor
Deixa eu te transformar na minha dama, garota, você me surpreende
Não precisa fazer nenhuma loucura
Veja, tudo que eu quero que você faça é ser o meu amor (
Então não ceda
)
Meu amor (
Então não ceda
)
Meu amor (
Então não ceda
)
Não existe outra mulher que poderia tomar o seu lugar
Meu amor (

Não existe outra mulher que poderia tomar o seu lugar, meu amor
Amor, garota, meu amor, meu amor
[Verso 2: Justin Timberlake]
Agora, se eu te escrevesse um bilhete de amor
E te fizesse sorrir a cada palavra que eu escrevesse (O que você faria?)
Isso faria você querer mudar de cena
E que ser a única do meu time? (Me diga, quer?)
Veja, qual é a vantagem em esperar mais?
Porque garota, eu nunca tive mais certeza (Isso, baby, é você)
Esse anel aqui representa o meu coração
E tudo que você estava esperando (Apenas diga, ""Eu aceito"")
Porque
[Refrão: Justin Timberlake e

Eu consigo ver a gente de mãos dadas
Caminhando na praia, nossos pés na areia
Eu posso ver a gente no campo

Beleza, é hora de conseguir, JT
Eu não sei por que você tá hesitando, cara
Ay, ay, ay
[Verso 3: T.I.]
A mina é refrescante igual um ventilador, em movimento mais uma vez (Ay)
Mas ele ainda tem fãs do Peru ao Japão
Hey, escuta, baby, eu não quero estragar seu plano (Não)
Mas se você tem um homem, tente perdê-lo se puder
Porque as garotas do mundo todo jogam as mãos pra cima
Quando elas querem vir e curtir com um cara rico
Você realmente não quer deixar essa chance passar
Porque você não foi vista com um homem tão foda
E, gata, com amigos tão fodas, eu posso voar
No privado, porque eu cuido do meu B.I
Eles me chamam de Candle Guy (Por quê?)
Simplesmente porque eu tô pegando fogo (Haha)
Eu odeio ter que cancelar as minhas férias, então você não pode negar
Eu sou paciente, mas não vou implorar (Não)
Se você não vier, eu não vou morrer
Calma aí, o que você quer dizer? Você não pode vir? Por quê? (Por quê?)
Eu e seu namorado, não temos laços (Uh-uh)
Você disse que quer curtir quando eu não tô tão chapado (Cara...)
Bem, baby, é óbvio que eu não o sou seu cara
Eu não vou mentir, vou preencher seu espaço
Mas esquecer o seu rosto, eu juro que vou
St. Bart's, Anguila, em qualquer lugar que eu relaxe (Legal)
Só trago comigo um par, eu vou (Vamo lá)
[Refrão: Justin Timberlake]
Eu consigo ver a gente de mãos dadas
Caminhando na praia, nossos pés na areia
Eu posso ver a gente no campo
Sentados na grama, deitados lado a lado
Você pode ser o meu amor
Deixa eu te transformar na minha dama, garota, você me surpreende
Não precisa fazer nenhuma loucura
Veja, tudo que eu quero que você faça é ser o meu amor (Amor)
Meu amor (Amor)
Meu amor (Amor)

[Перевод песни Eminem — «Shake That» ft. Nate Dogg]
[Интро: Eminem,
Nate Dogg
]
Воу!
Shady, Aftermath
Смотри на эту сучку
Оу, боже, привет (Чёрт!)
[Рефрен: Eminem, Nate Dogg]
Вот она идёт, тряся этой жопой под бит
Трясясь и гладя этот шест
Как она гладит этот шест…
Кажется, я теряю контроль
[Куплет 1: Eminem]
Оживляйся, пьяней, возбуждайся
Нажирайся, иди в стрип-клуб
Не забудь деньги, потри свой член и трахни кого-нибудь
Пусть тебе отсосут, напейся в дрова
Бухой, ушатанный – блевани, выпей, стошни
Возьми ещё бокал, ударь раковину в туалете, стошни
Протри обувь дочиста, займись своими делами
Всё ещё осталось пару кусочков на шнурках…
Я был обезвожен, пока бит не завибрировал
Я воскрес только когда эта сука закрутила
Своими бедрами и облизала губы, и тут началось
Мне нужно было позвать Nate Dogg, чтобы он спел какую-нибудь херь
[Куплет 2: Nate Dogg]
Two to the one, from the one to the three
Я люблю хорошие киски и хорошие
кусты
Выкурил столько травы, что ты не поверишь
И я вижу больше задниц, чем стульчак унитаза
Три и один, и один и три
Я встретил плохую сучку прошлой ночью в Детройте
Дай расскажу, как я провёл с ней время:
Беседа и Hennessy
Я был на ёбаной вершине горы
Слушал разговоры долбаёбов, видел как они падают
Если у меня не будет пушки, я возьму камень
И когда я вставлю тебе в жопу, я продолжу двигаться
Оторви свою неуклюжую жопу от стены
Это правда легко, просто следуй за битом
Не дай этой сучке пройти мимо
Смотри ближе — стробоскопы врут
[Предприпев: Nate Dogg]
У нас намечается вечеринка (Включи музыку громче)
Пусть она начнётся (Включайся и тряси своей жопой)
Я ищу тёлку с сексуальным телом и походкой
Хочешь, чтобы он вырос? Иди сюда
Несколько сук прикидываются отсталыми
Несколько скоро станут ими, станут ими
Я ищу тёлку, которая будет делать всё, что блять захочет
Я говорю, каждый день она будет мне отдаваться
[Припев: Nate Dogg]
(А сейчас) Тряси этой жопой для меня
Тряси этой жопой для меня, давай, крошка
Тряси этой жопой для меня
Тряси этой жопой для меня, о, крошка
Тряси этой жопой для меня
Тряси этой жопой для меня, давай, крошка
Тряси этой жопой для меня
Тряси этой жопой для меня
[Куплет 3: Eminem]
Я угроза, дантист, гигиенист
Открой свой рот на четыре-пять минут
Возьми немного фтористого ополаскивателя
Свистни, но не сплюнь; проглоти и всё, да
Я и Nate D, O, дважды G
Ищем сук с двумя D
Выпей шампанского и пару E
Подсыпь их ей в игристое, мы готовы, готовы к…
[Куплет 4: Nate Dogg,

У нас намечается вечеринка (Включи музыку громче)
Пусть она начнётся (Включайся и тряси своей жопой)
Я ищу тёлку, которую смогу трахнуть в своём Hummer'е
Джинсы Apple Bottom и старина большая жопа
Несколько сук прикидываются отсталыми
Несколько скоро станут ими, станут ими (Мужик, я говорю тебе…)
Я ищу тёлку, которая ляжет ко мне в постельку без трусиков
Она может, но не хочет отказываться
(А сейчас) Посмотри на эту леди передо мной
Сексуальна настолько, насколько может
Ночью я хочу шлюху, будешь моей?
Друг рассказывал, ты просто чокнутая
Надеюсь, ты не обиделась на меня
Но я сказал Нэйту, что ты просто чокнутая
Он сказал, хочет шлюху, надеюсь ты не против
Я сказал, как ты любишь быть спереди
[Припев: Nate Dogg]
(А сейчас) Тряси этой жопой для меня
Тряси этой жопой для меня, давай, крошка
Тряси этой жопой для меня
Тряси этой жопой для меня, о, крошка
Тряси этой жопой для меня
Тряси этой жопой для меня, давай, крошка
Тряси этой жопой для меня
Тряси этой жопой для меня
[Предприпев: Nate Dogg]
У нас намечается вечеринка (Включи музыку громче)
Пусть она начнётся (Включайся и тряси своей жопой)
Я ищу тёлку с сексуальным телом и походкой
Хочешь, чтобы он вырос? Иди сюда
Несколько сук прикидываются отсталыми
Несколько скоро станут ими, станут ими
Я ищу тёлку, которая будет делать всё, что блять захочет
Я говорю, каждый день она будет мне отдаваться
[Рефрен: Nate Dogg & Eminem]
Вот она идёт, тряся этой жопой под бит
Сталкиваясь и гладя этот шест
Как она гладит этот шест…
Кажется, я теряю контроль
[Аутро: Eminem]
Боже
Я не уйду без тебя, сука!
Едешь домой со мной!
И мой друг, и его друг
И его друг
И его девочка
Ха-ха, Nate Dogg!"

Pullin’ Me Back Lyrics
Every time I try to leave something keeps pulling me back (me back)
Telling me I need you in my life
Every time I try to go, something keeps telling me that (me that)
Everything gon be all right
Every time I try to leave something keeps pulling me back (me back)
Telling me I need you in my life
It was meant to be, you were meant for me
So that means we gotta make it work
It was all good at first, spendin' money, goin' shoppin'
Eatin' at the finest restaurants, and if I'm club hoppin'
She was right thur wit me bottle poppin' livin' that life (livin' that life)
She just didn't understand my lifestyle and that ain't life (and that ain't life)
All of the jewelry in the world, gotcha diamonds, gotcha pearls
But I can't help it if Chinga-ling be attractin' all the girls
Guess what, baby I'mma superstar, and that come wit it
Gotta good nigga on ya side, you betta run wit it
Even tho I'm on the road doin' shows
I made time for me and her relationship to grow (grow)
They tell me don't trust the woman in this industry
But, she not any woman, more like a sacred friend to me
Cuz when I'm outta town always think of huurr
Might conversate wit some chicks but, no one come above huurr, oh
I thought I was ya man, guess you ain't understand
And now I'm sittin' here lookin' crazy like ""damn""
Every time I try to leave something keeps pulling me back (me back)
Telling me I need you in my life
Every time I try to go, something keeps telling me that (me that)
Everything gon be all right
Every time I try to leave something keeps pulling me back (me back)
Telling me I need you in my life
It was meant to be, you were meant for me
So that means we gotta make it work
Walked in the house wit hard work, my head hurt
Instead of arguin' can I have dinner wit some dessert? Uhh-uhh
She talkin' bout this phone number she found
Ain't gimme time to put my bags down, she straight up clownin' (straight up clownin')
Before we end up fightin' lemme me leave
I'm exhausted, and this herree, I don't need (I don't need)
Now I'm wit the fellaz, ridin' and drinkin' (ridin' and drinkin')
She blowin' my two-way up, but I need some time for thinkin' (time for thinkin') yeah
I wanna go back, but sumthin' sayin' naw (naw)
Lemme give her some space, and the next day I might call (call)
What should I do, look, lemme ask ya'll
Should I stand tall, or let this relationship fall? (fall)
I never havin' my feelings crushed, but it happens sometimes
Either love it or give it up
I thought I was ya man, guess you ain't understand
And now I'm sittin' here lookin' crazy like ""damn""
Every time I try to leave something keeps pulling me back (me back)
Telling me I need you in my life
Every time I try to go, something keeps telling me that (me that)
Everything gon be all right
Every time I try to leave something keeps pulling me back (me back)
Telling me I need you in my life
It was meant to be, you were meant for me
So that means we gotta make it work
(Chingy, holla at em again)
To all the fellaz, know you feel me, you ever had a woman
Good times let the bad times, and you ain't see it comin'
Tried the best to make her happy (happy), but it wasn't enough (it wasn't enough)
Cuz mama told me in relationships the road get rough (road get rough)
And I ain't the one to have my head down, weeping, stressed out
As bad as it hurts I gotta move to the next route (route), yes
I thought I was a man, guess she ain't understand
And now she sittin' thurr, lookin' crazy like ""damn""
Every time I try to leave something keeps pulling me back (me back)
Telling me I need you in my life
Every time I try to go, something keeps telling me that (me that)
Everything gon be all right
Every time I try to leave something keeps pulling me back (me back)
Telling me I need you in my life
It was meant to be, you were meant for me
So that means we gotta make it work
Say we gotta make it work"

Bossy Lyrics
Ayo
You don't have to love me
You don't even have to like me
But you will respect me
You know why?
'Cause I'm a boss
Uh, uh, watch that thing go
Uh, uh, watch that thing go
(Bangladesh)
Uh, uh, watch that thing go
Uh, uh, watch that thing go
I'm bossy, I'm the first girl to scream on a track
I switched up the beat of the drum
That's right, I brought all the boys to the yard
And that's right, I'm the one that's tattooed on his arm
,
,
I'm bossy, I'm the bitch y'all love to hate
I'm the chick that's raised the stake
I told Young Stunna he should switch to BAPE
I'm back with an 808 'cause I'm bossy
Ooh, let me slow it down so you can catch the flow
Screw it up, make it go extra slow
Real girls get down on the floor
(On the floor, get down on the floor)
Ooh, I gave you a taste, you want some more?
Touch down on me, throw it up like a pro
I ride the beat like a bicycle, I'm icy cold
Ooh, from the 6-4 hoppers up in Crenshaw
The money makin' playas up in Harlem
Don't want no problems
We gon' keep it bumpin while the 808 is jumpin'
Diamonds on my neck, di-diamonds on my grill
Diamonds on my neck, di-diamonds on my grill
I'm bossy, I'm the first girl to scream on a track
I switched up the beat of the drum
That's right, I brought all the boys to the yard
And that's right, I'm the one that's tattooed on his arm
I'm bossy, I'm the bitch y'all love to hate
I'm the chick that's raised the stake
I told Young Stunna he should switch to BAPE
I'm back with an 808 'cause I'm bossy
Ooh, bet ya never heard it like this before
Me and my baby be closin' them Phantom doors
Bar poppin' ish that you can't afford
Can't afford
Ooh, I'm chokin'
Blastin' the clouds, it's all smokin'
All the while I'm all open
Me and my girls, we stay fly and I love to stay high
Ooh, from the 6-4 hoppers up in Crenshaw
The money makin' playas up in Harlem
Don't want no problems
We gon' keep it bumpin while the 808 is jumpin'
Diamonds on my neck, di-diamonds on my grill
Diamonds on my neck, di-diamonds on my grill
I'm bossy, I'm the first girl to scream on a track
I switched up the beat of the drum
That's right, I brought all the boys to the yard
And that's right, I'm the one that's tattooed on his arm
I'm bossy, I'm the bitch y'all love to hate
I'm the chick that's raised the stake
I told Young Stunna he should switch to BAPE
I'm back with an 808 'cause I'm bossy
It's 'bout time that she get with me
Can't stop starin', she's fine and she's pretty
Damn girl, don't hurt 'em
If niggas don't back that, you gon work 'em
Put your mack down, I know your background
What you want, girl? You gettin' that now
That's how you do it, huh? Well, I'm the coolest one
Them badbitches in the back, bring 'em to the front
Bitch! Tell that man you's a boss bitch
Make some noise, raise your hand if you's a boss bitch
I don't think he understands you's a boss bitch
Get some help if you can, 'cause he lost it
Ain't no refunds—she spent the cash, man
In your Benz with her friends in the fast lane, flossin'
He said, ""How much it cost me?""
About a million dollars, player—she's bossy
I'm bossy, I'm the first girl to scream on a track
I switched up the beat of the drum
That's right, I brought all the boys to the yard
And that's right, I'm the one that's tattooed on his arm
I'm bossy, I'm the bitch y'all love to hate
I'm the chick that's raised the stake
I told Young Stunna he should switch to BAPE
I'm back with an 808 'cause I'm bossy
Uh, uh, watch that thing go
Uh, uh, watch that thing go
Uh, uh, watch that thing go
Uh, uh, watch that thing go
Uh, uh, watch that thing go
Uh, uh, watch that thing go
Uh, uh, watch that thing go
Uh, uh, watch that thing go

Chain Hang Low Lyrics
Jibbs samples from the classic song “Do Your Ears Hang Low?” to let us know just how low his chain hangs.
Beatstaz!
Do your chain hang low?
Do it wobble to the flo'?
Do it shine in the light?
Is it platinum, is it gold?
Could you thow it over your shoulder?
If ya hot, it'd make ya cold?
(Oh)
Do your chain
(Oh)
hang
(Oh)
low?
[Refrain]
Is that ya chain?
'Bout twenty-four inches is how low I let it hang
Hop out the ride and let the dime smoke off the range
Just by the chain, you can tell the big kid do his thang
You know the name
Is that ya chain?
'Bout twenty-four inches is how low I let it hang
Hop out the ride and let the dime smoke off the range
Just by the chain, you can tell the big kid do his thang
I'm off the chain
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm hot, kid
Chain so low, you would think the diamonds never stopped it
And it's funny 'cause you could never stop it
A bunch of rocks on my hand and I ain't even on the block, kid
Show 'em white gold, sorta hold it like my Timbs
And the chain hang twenty-four inches like the rims
Diamonds all blown up (Yeah), sorta like a pimp
So when the light hit the ice, it starts glistenin' off the tip (Glistenin' off the tip)
My chain hang, all it do is bling-bling
Half blue, half red, like my diamonds gang-bang
And I don't even think we on the same thang
Charm so heavy, they couldn't lift it 'til the crane came (Yeah)
Do your chain hang low?
Do it wobble to the flo'?
Do it shine in the light?
Is it platinum, is it gold?
Could you throw it over your shoulder?
If ya hot, it'd make ya cold?
Do your chain hang low?
Do your chain hang low?
Do it wobble to the flo'?
Do it shine in the light?
Is it platinum, is it gold?
Could you throw it over your shoulder?
If ya hot, it'd make ya cold?
Do your chain hang low?
(
Chain
) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm so icy (
Do your chain—
)
My charm so heavy that my neck don't like me (
Do your chain—
)
Gone and no, no, no, its not a game, kid (
Do your chain—
)
'Cause I'll throw my chain in the crowd like Game did (
Do your chain—
, this is nothin')
Diamonds is nothin' to me (
Do it shine—
)
Especially when I'm dressin' up, it's just a button to me (Bling)
(
Could you through it over your shoulder?
)
And not to mention my tees
'Cause they color coordinated, complimentin' the teeth (Alright, thanks)
So check out my swag
The diamonds red, white and blue like the American flag (
Do it shine—
, the boy is so colorful)
And see I got that nice cream
My money I spent on jewels, I call it my ice cream (
Ch-ch-chain
)
Give you a black eye 'cause of the beating
They think I am a mutant, the way your boy is beasting (
Ch-ch-chain
)
I stay winnin' some time, you will call it cheating
Yeah, my boys always around (Oh) like it's a meeting
[Refrain]
Is that ya chain? (
Do your chain—
)
'Bout twenty-four inches is how low I let it hang (
Do your chain—
)
Hop out the ride and let the dime smoke off the range (
Do your chain—
)
Just by the chain you can tell the big kid do his thang (
Do your chain—
)
You know the name
Is that ya chain? (
Do your chain—
)
'Bout twenty-four inches is how low I let it hang (
Do your chain—
)
Hop out the ride and let the dime smoke off the range (
Do your chain—
)
Just by the chain you can tell the big kid do his thang (
Do your chain—
)
I'm off the chain
Do your chain hang low?
Do it wobble to the flo'?
Do it shine in the light?
Is it platinum, is it gold?
Could you throw it over your shoulder?
If ya hot, it'd make ya cold?
Do your chain hang low?
Do your chain hang low?
Do it wobble to the flo'?
Do it shine in the light?
Is it platinum, is it gold?
Could you throw it over your shoulder?
If ya hot, it'd make ya cold?
Do your chain hang low?"

One Wish Lyrics
[Skit]
Can I talk to you for a minute? (Ooh)
You know, I be thinkin' to myself
We had a lot of good times together (Come on, baby, come on, darlin', come here, darlin')
We did everything together
Yeah, we would wake up early in the mornin' (All I need, all I need, all I need is a chance to make it right)
And just get in the car and just ride on out (Just one chance)
Remember that? (All I need, all I need is just one wish)
Used to watch the sunrise (One wish, one wish)
Used to watch the sunset (All I need, all I need, all I need is a chance to make it right)
We was everything to each other, you know? (Just one chance)
(All I need, all I need, is just one wish) Damn, I miss those days
(One wish, one wish, one wish)
(All I need, all I need, all I need is a chance to make it right)
If I could just, if I could just hold you in my arms, you know what I mean? (All I need, all I need, is just one wish, one wish)
It just feels so good (One wish, one little, itty, bitty wish)
If I could just have one wish
Damn, baby
Just don't understand where we went wrong
I gave you my heart
I gave you my soul
I gave you—
As a matter of fact, I was the one who said I loved you first
It was about eight years ago, don't act like you don't know
We were sittin' at home in your mama's livin' room
'Cause we couldn't be alone
See, your mama knew I was somethin' else, she knew how I felt
Back then, we were in school and that's your favorite excuse
Growin' up, I was a fool and I can't lie, I'm missin' you
Listen and don't trip
I think I need a bottle with a genie in it
Here's my wish list
First one, I would create a heart-changin' love
Second one, I'll take yours and fill it all up
Third one, but I don't need a lot of wishes
'Cause I'll be okay if I get one
If I had one wish, we would be best friends
Love would never end, it would just begin
If I had one wish, you would be my boo
Promise to love you, trust me, I'll trust you
If I had one wish, we would run away
Makin' love all day, have us a baby
If I had one wish, I'd make you my whole life
And you'll be my wife, make it right this time
If I had one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish
Now, tell me, is this the only way I can get you right back in?
If so, then searchin' I'll go, then I can have you for sho
Then you'll be lovin' me, holdin' me, kissin' me
So girl, don't tell me what I'm feelin' is make-believe
I swear, if I lose a second chance with you
I wouldn't know what to do
I'll probably check myself into some kind of clinic
I couldn't be alone because without you, I'm sick
Here's my wish list
First one, I would create a heart-changin' love
Second one, I'll take yours and fill it all up
Third one, but I don't need a lot of wishes
'Cause I'll be okay if I get one
If I had one wish, we would be best friends
Love would never end, it would just begin
(Startin' here, right now)
If I had one wish, you would be my boo
Promise to love you (Promise love), trust me, I'll trust you (I'll trust you)
If I had one wish, we would run away (Yes, we would)
Makin' love all day (It would feel so good), have us a baby (Woo)
If I had one wish, I'd make you my whole life (Oh, yeah)
And you'll be my wife, make it right this time
If I had one wish
I don't even know how we ended up on this road
And, even though we are grown, girl, I just want you to know
If I had one wish, we would be best friends
Love would never end, it would just begin
(Introducin' yourself all over again)
If I had one wish, you would be my boo (Would you be my girlfriend?)
Promise to love you (Yes, I promise to love you), trust me, I'll trust you (Trust me, baby, and I'll trust you)
If I had one wish (One wish), we would run away (One wish)
Makin' love all day (One wish), have us a baby (Have us a baby)
If I had one wish (Ooh), I'd make you my whole life (Yes, I will)
And you'll be my wife (Yes, I will), make it right this time
If I had one wish, we would be best friends (Some people wish to be a superstar, wish to have a fancy car)
Love would never end, it would just begin (Wish to have a million bucks, I'm wishin' on bein' in love)
If I had one wish, you would be my boo (So feel me, pretty baby)
Promise to love you, trust me, I'll trust you (I'd make one wish and I'd wish it all on you)
If I had one wish (Oh), we would run away (Oh)
Makin' love all day, have us a baby (Makin' love 'til the break of dawn, me and you 'til the baby's born)
If I had one wish, I'd make you my whole life (Yeah, yeah)
And you'll be my wife, make it right this time
If I had one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish"

Sugar, We’re Goin’ Down Lyrics
Am I more than you bargained for yet?
I've been dyin' to tell you
Anything you want to hear
'Cause that's just who I am this week
Lie in the grass next to the mausoleum
I'm just a notch in your bedpost, but you're just a line in a song
(Notch in your bedpost, but you're just a line in a song)
Drop a heart
And break a name
We're always sleeping in and sleeping
For the wrong team
We're goin' down, down in an earlier round
And sugar, we're going down swingin'
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it
We're goin' down, down in an earlier round
And sugar, we're going down swingin'
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it
Is this more than you bargained for yet?
Oh, don't mind me, I'm watching
You two from the closet
Wishing to be the friction in your jeans
Isn't it messed up how I'm just dyin' to be him?
I'm just a notch in your bedpost, but you're just a line in a song
(Notch in your bedpost, but you're just a line in a song)
Drop a heart
And break a name
We're always sleeping in and sleeping
For the wrong team
We're goin' down, down in an earlier round
And sugar, we're going down swingin'
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it
We're goin' down, down in an earlier round
And sugar, we're going down swingin'
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it
Down, down in an earlier round
And sugar, we're going down swingin'
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it
We're going down, down in an earlier round
(Take aim at myself)
And sugar, we're going down swingin'
(Take back what you said)
I'll be your number one with a bullet
(Take aim at myself)
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it
We're goin' down, down (down, down)
Down, down (down, down)
We're goin' down, down (down, down)
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it
We're goin' down, down in an earlier round
(Take aim at myself)
And sugar, we're going down swingin'
(Take back what you said)
I'll be your number one with a bullet
(Take aim at myself)
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it"

Chris Brown - Gimme That ft. Lil Wayne (Traducción al Español) Lyrics
[Letra de ""Chris Brown - Gimme That ft. Lil Wayne (Traducción al Español)""]
[Verso 1: Lil Wayne]
El joven Carter, soy mejor que los otros
No miento, me puedo tomar un verano libre
Puedo hacerselo a una mujer, puedo adelgazarla
Uno de mis coches, ahora voy sobre cosas buenas
Alinéalo, te garantizo que te voy a servir
El joven Chris dijo, ""run it"", así que corrí y se lo dije
Soy el joven Cash Money, Birdman Junior
Un presidente buscando una Monica
[Verso 2: Chris Brown]
El joven acaba de hacer 16, tengo el 64 (Chevrolet) y buenas motos
Tengo a 3 o 4 chicas, pero todo ese movimiento en ese bikini me vuelve loco
Para todo el tráfico en un ""stop"" porque hablas ese idioma que hablo
Ese tempo descarado con ese andar, quizás es la razón que todas estas no me verán
[Estribillo]
Puedes ser 3 años mayor pero estás bien, dame eso
Hablas como si te gustara lo que tengo, dame eso
Sé que te gusta como voy en mi Cadillac
Podrías estar en la parte de atrás diciendo, dame, dame, dame
Puedes ser 3 años mayor pero estás bien, dame eso
Hablas como si te gustara lo que tengo, dame eso
Sé que te gusta como voy en mi Cadillac
Podrías estar en la parte de atrás diciendo, dame, dame, dame
[Verso 3: Chris Brown]
Un descanso, dejame explicarte, que tu cuerpo me tiene preparado para hacerlo
Si tomas la oportunidad de que me ponga encima
Te puedo enseñar porqué lo hago bien, sobresalientes en la escuela
Soy un luchador, confia en mi y en mi edad, te tengo pensando de que soy demasiado joven para hacerlo
Puedo imaginarnos cambiando de carril en el Coupe, contigo en el teléfono gritando mi nombre, Chris
[Estribillo]
Puedes ser 3 años mayor pero estás bien, dame eso
Hablas como si te gustara lo que tengo, dame eso
Sé que te gusta como voy en mi Cadillac
Podrías estar en la parte de atrás diciendo, dame, dame, dame
Puedes ser 3 años mayor pero estás bien, dame eso
Hablas como si te gustara lo que tengo, dame eso
Sé que te gusta como voy en mi Cadillac
Podrías estar en la parte de atrás diciendo, dame, dame, dame
[Puente]
Chica, en serio, te he estado mirando, esto es lo que tu cuerpo dice
Esto es lo que tu cuerpo dice
[Verso 4: Lil Wayne]
Cariño, ¿qué tal?, intento saludarte
No estoy decepcionado, pero te cegaré si te sonrío
Estás con el joven Chris y el mejor rapero
Deja tu teléfono, trae a tus amigas, deja que lo demás pase
Un poco de Patron, Hennessy, estoy bebiendo Cavalli Vodka
Llevo tejanos y calzoncillos Cavalli, mejor que un recién nacido
Puedo trabajarte como un sofá
Puedes quedarte desnuda
Me dejo las botas y mis joyas
Nunca sé lo que quieras, voy a dejarmelo puesto
Nunca sabes quién está en casa, lo aprendí de esa canción de Biggie
A una nueva, algo como una blanca
Creo que le gusto, me tiene de tono de llamada
Y le dije, ""Ten lo tuyo y no pares""
Dame ese ritmo y lo que tienes
[Estribillo]
Puedes ser 3 años mayor pero estás bien, dame eso
Hablas como si te gustara lo que tengo, dame eso
Sé que te gusta como voy en mi Cadillac
Podrías estar en la parte de atrás diciendo, dame, dame, dame
Puedes ser 3 años mayor pero estás bien, dame eso
Hablas como si te gustara lo que tengo, dame eso
Sé que te gusta como voy en mi Cadillac
Podrías estar en la parte de atrás diciendo, dame, dame, dame"

Who Says You Can’t Go Home Lyrics
I spent twenty years tryin' to get out of this place
I was lookin' for something I couldn't replace
I was runnin' away from the only thing I've ever known
Like a blind dog without a bone
I was a gypsy lost in the twilight zone
I hijacked a rainbow and crashed into a pot of gold
I been there, done that
Now I ain't looking back on the seeds I've sown
Savin' dimes, spendin' too much time on the telephone
Who says you can't go home?
Who says you can't go home?
There's only one place they call me one of their own
Just a hometown boy, born a rollin' stone
Who says you can't go home?
Who says you can't go back?
Been all around the world and as a matter of fact
There's only one place left I wanna go
Who says you can't go home?
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
It's alright, it's alright
I went as far as I could, I tried to find a new face
There isn't one of these lines that I would erase
I've lived a million miles of memories on that road
With every step I take, I know that I'm not alone
You take the home from the boy, but not the boy from his home
These are my streets, the only life I've ever known
Who says you can't go home?
Who says you can't go home?
There's only one place they call me one of their own
Just a hometown boy, born a rollin' stone
Who says you can't go home?
Who says you can't go back?
Been all around the world and as a matter of fact
There's only one place left I wanna go
Who says you can't go home?
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
It's alright, it's alright
Who says you can't go home?
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
It's alright, it's alright
Who says you can't go home?
[Guitar Solo]
I been there, done that
Now I ain't looking back
It's been a long, long road
Feels like I never left, that's how the story goes
It doesn't matter where you are, it doesn't matter where you go
If it's a million miles away or just a mile up the road
Take it in, take it with you when you go
Who says you can't go home?
Who says you can't go home?
There's only one place they call me one of their own
Just a hometown boy, born a rollin' stone
Who says you can't go home?
Who says you can't go back?
Been all around the world and as a matter of fact
There's only one place left I wanna go
Who says you can't go home?
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
It's alright, it's alright
Who says you can't go home?
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
It's alright, it's alright
Who says you can't go home?
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
It's alright, it's alright
Who says you can't go home?"

Too Little Too Late Lyrics
Mmh no, mmh...
Mmh-mmh
Come with me, stay the night
You say the words, but boy, it don't feel right
What do ya expect me to say?
(You know it's just too little too late)
You take my hand, and you say you've changed
But boy, you know your begging don't fool me
Because to you, it's just a game
(You know it's just too little too late)
So let me on down
'Cause time has made me strong
I'm starting to move on
I'm gonna say this now
Your chance has come and gone
And you know...
It's just too little too late
A little too wrong, and I can't wait
But you know all the right things to say
You know it's just too little too late
You say you dream of my face
But you don't like me, you just like the chase
To be real, it doesn't matter anyway
You know it's just too little too late
Yeah, yeah
It's just too little too late
Mmh-mmh
I was young and in love
I gave you everything, but it wasn't enough
And now you wanna communicate
Huh (You know it's just too little too late)
Go find someone else
In letting you go, I'm loving myself
You got a problem
But don't come asking me for help
'Cause you know...
It's just too little too late
A little too wrong, and I can't wait
But you know all the right things to say
You know it's just too little too late
You say you dream of my face
But you don't like me, you just like the chase
To be real, it doesn't matter anyway
You know it's just too little too late
I can love with all of my heart, baby
I know I have so much to give (I've got so much to give)
With a player like you, I don't have a prayer
That's no way to live, oh, oh-ooh
Mmh no, whoa whoa
It's just too little too late
Yeah, yeah!
It's just too little too late (Too little, too late)
A little too wrong, and I can't wait (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
But you know all the right things to say (Woo!)
You know it's just too little too late
You say you dream of my face
But you don't like me, you just like the chase (You just like the chase baby)
To be real, it doesn't matter anyway (Hey, hey)
You know it's just too little too late (Ah, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You know it's just too little too late (Ooh)
I can't wait, no, no, no...
It's just too little too late
A little too wrong, and I can't wait
But you know all the right things to say (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You know it's just too little too late
You say you dream of my face
But you don't like me, you just like the chase
To be real, it doesn't matter anyway

Los barrios están ready
One, two, get ready, come on!
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

Rompe, rompe, rompe, break it down
Rompe, rompe, rompe, the way she moves, ella lo—
Rompe, rompe, rompe, break it down
Let's go
[Verso 1]
My boo, no se limita a la hora de romper su
pum-pum
Con curvas más calientes que el sur, right through
Enséñame si tienes la actitud, mami
Dale, go! Dale, go! Dale, go! Go!
Tiempo; llegó el momento, baby, de perder el control
Trabájame ese cuerpo más que un
shot de Winstrol
Sube ese temperamento, dame movimiento
Lento, lento, ella lo—
[Coro]
Rompe, rompe, rompe, bien guilla'o
Rompe, rompe, rompe, ese cuerpo ella lo—
Rompe, rompe, rompe, bien guilla'o

Rompe, rompe, rompe, the way she moves, ella lo—
Rompe, rompe, rompe, break it down
G-Go! G-Go! G-Go! G-Go!
[Puente]
Voy chillin', tranquilo, that's right
Buscando una gata que cae
No escondas todo eso que traes
Yo', baby, ¿qué es la que hay?
Voy chillin', tranquilo, that's right
Buscando una gata que cae
No escondas todo eso que trae'
¿Qué pasa, socio, qué es la que hay?
(What!? What!? What!? What!?)
[Verso 2]
Pinche, güey, ¿pensaste que esto era un mamey?
No vo' a dar break, deja ese guille de Scarface
Get out my way, usted no vende ni en eBay
No das pa' na', conmigo 'tás Frito-Lay
Chequea el swing
Que se le pega a to'as las nenas más que un
G-string
Yo soy la pesadilla de todo' los dream team
Ya se te acabó el magazine
Conmigo no te la guilles, pa', de Listerine
Daddy te—

Woo
Mm, yeah
Life's like a road that you travel on
When there's one day here and the next day gone
Sometimes you bend, sometimes you stand
Sometimes you turn your back to the wind
There's a world outside every darkened door
Where blues won't haunt you anymore
Where the brave are free and lovers soar
Come ride with me to the distant shore
We won't hesitate
To break down the garden gate
There's not much time left today, yeah
Life is a highway
I wanna ride it all night long
If you're goin' my way
Well, I wanna drive it all night long
Through all these cities and all these towns
It's in my blood and it's all around
I love you now like I loved you then
This is the road and these are the hands
From Mozambique to those Memphis nights
The Khyber Pass to Vancouver's lights
Knock me down, I'm back up again
You're in my blood, I'm not a lonely man
There's no load I can't hold
A road so rough, this I know
I'll be there when the light comes in
Just tell 'em we're survivors
Life is a highway
Well, I wanna ride it all night long (Woo)
If you're goin' my way
I wanna drive it all night long (All night long)
A gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, yeah
Life is a highway
Well, I wanna ride it all night long (Mm, yeah)
If you're goin' my way (You're goin' my way)
I wanna drive it all night long (All night long)
There was a distance between you and I (Between you and I)
A misunderstanding once
But now we look it in the eye
Ooh, yeah (Mm, yeah)
[Instrumental Break]
[Refrain]
There ain't no load that I can't hold
The roads are rough, this I know
I'll be there when the light comes in
Tell 'em we're survivors
Life is a highway
Well, I wanna ride it all night long (All night long, yeah)
If you're goin' my way
Well, I wanna drive it all night long (A gimme, gimme, gimme, a gimme, gimme, yeah)
Life is a highway (Life is a highway)
I wanna ride it all night long (Woo, yeah)
If you're goin' my way (You're goin' my way)
I wanna drive it all night long (All night long, yeah; come on, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, yeah)
Life is a highway
I wanna ride it all night long (Yeah, I wanna drive it all night long, baby)
If you're goin' my way (You're goin' my way)

Don't cry to me, if you loved me
You would be here with me
You want me, come find me
Make up your mind
Should I let you fall? Lose it all?
So maybe you can remember yourself
Can't keep believing, we're only deceiving
Ourselves, and I'm sick of the lie
And you're too late
Don't cry to me, if you loved me
You would be here with me
You want me, come find me
Make up your mind
Couldn't take the blame, sick with shame
Must be exhausting to lose your own game
Selfishly hated, no wonder you're jaded
You can't play the victim this time
And you're too late
So don't cry to me, if you loved me
You would be here with me
You want me, come find me
Make up your mind
You never call me when you're sober
You only want it 'cause it's over
Ah, it's over
How could I
Have burned paradise?
How could I
You were never mine
So don't cry to me, if you loved me
You would be here with me
Don't lie to me, just get your things
I've made up your mind"

She was drivin' last Friday on the way to Cincinnati
On a snow-white Christmas Eve
Goin' home to see her mama and her daddy
With the baby in the backseat
Fifty miles to go and she was runnin' low
On faith and gasoline
It'd been a long hard year
She had a lot on her mind and she didn't pay attention
She was goin' way too fast
Before she knew it
She was spinnin' on a thin black sheet of glass
She saw both their lives flash before her eyes
She didn't even have time to cry
She was so scared
She threw her hands up in the air
Jesus, take the wheel
Take it from my hands
'Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on
Jesus, take the wheel
It was still gettin' colder when she made it to the shoulder
And the car came to a stop
She cried when she saw that baby in the backseat
Sleepin' like a rock
And for the first time in a long time
She bowed her head to pray
She said, ""I'm sorry for the way
I've been livin' my life
I know I've got to change
So from now on tonight""
""Jesus, take the wheel
Take it from my hands
'Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on
Oh, Jesus, take the wheel
Oh, I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on
From this road I'm on

Oh, take it, take it from me""

Then I had to take him to the right

And the ladies know soon as they see my jewelry
If bein' fresh to death is a crime
I think it's time for me to see the jury

Smokin' on that Cali Kush, my boy sells it by the bush
I'm packin' heat with the .45 magnum in my belt
Shawty lookin' so fine, wish I could've felt
When I drugged the bitch, the drug I could've melt
I'm feelin' so fine in the back of my Hummer
Ridin' down a main street, I'm stuntin' like a winner
I've been in the running for a long time
I feel it's safe to say that DPalm can bust a bomb rhyme
When I write down a verse, there ain't no controversy
Look at your bitch, she's fifteen, call that statutory
Smokin' on Arabian shit, don't you know? the good stuff
The smoke hit the back of your throat, the shit is rough
Told you suckers, DPalm gonna murder this investigation
Who's the next bad rapper? Turnin' on a mutilator
Fry you bitches up in, what is called frialator
I worked at fast food, don't fuck with what I'm sayin'
I don't wanna be the next rapper on TV
I just wanna be me, enough about succeeding
Smokin' spliffs and we be hittin' that Mauwie Wowie shit
Drinkin 'til we daze-y, knockin' back down shots of Bacardi
Parental advisory stickers all over my merchandise
Like I was gonna put a ""Fuck you"" in front of my merchants' eyes
Who the fuck is Dana Carvey? I'm the master of disguise
Get as high as I am right now, and you'll be clappin' in the skies
Don't be foolish, that plot's kinda like the flick ""Mission: Impossible""
Your homeboy's sayin' shit that got me actin' kinda pausible
(Pause) That's A.K.A. for actin' gay
Concoct your own acronym for ""Prez is gonna spray""
Best believe me, I'll do it, my words are the truest
And I will throw some shit that leaves you lyin' in your fluids
Young Money co-signer, please free Weezy
So we can be broadcast live, like cable TV
I'm new to this league, but great like John Wall
We be burnin', Sean Paul, hard to kill, Steven Seagal
We goin' in, like a robber, hide your toddler
Windows we smash 'em, TVs we grab 'em, don't holler
No problems, solutions we got 'em

Hate Me Lyrics
(If you're sleeping, are you dreaming?
If you're dreaming, are you dreaming of me?
I can't believe you actually picked me)
(”Hi Justin, this is your mother, and it's 2:33 on Monday afternoon
I was just calling to see how you were doing
You sounded really uptight last night
It made me a little nervous, and a l... and... well... it made me nervous, it sounded like you were nervous, too
I just wanted to make sure you were really okay
And wanted to see if you were checking in on your medication
You know I love you, and...
Take care, honey
I know you're under a lot of pressure
See ya. Bye bye”)
I have to block out thoughts of you so I don’t lose my head
They crawl in like a cockroach, leaving babies in my bed
Dropping little reels of tape to remind me that I’m alone
Playing movies in my head that make a porno feel like home
There's a burning in my pride, a nervous bleeding in my brain
An ounce of peace is all I want for you; will you never call again?
And will you never say that you loved me just to put it in my face?
And will you never try to reach me?
It is I that wanted space
Hate me today
Hate me tomorrow
Hate me for all the things I didn't do for you
Hate me in ways
Yeah, ways hard to swallow
Hate me so you can finally see what’s good for you
I’m sober now for 3 whole months
It’s one accomplishment that you helped me with
The one thing that always tore us apart is the one thing I won’t touch again
In a sick way, I want to thank you for holding my head up late at night
While I was busy waging wars on myself, you were trying to stop the fight
You never doubted my warped opinions on things like suicide and hate
You made me compliment myself when it was way too hard to take
So I’ll drive so fucking far away that I never cross your mind
And do whatever it takes in your heart to leave me behind
Hate me today
Hate me tomorrow
Hate me for all the things I didn't do for you
Hate me in ways
Yeah, ways hard to swallow
Hate me so you can finally see what’s good for you
And with a sad heart, I say bye to you and wave
Kicking shadows on the street for every mistake that I had made
And like a baby boy, I never was a man
Until I saw your blue eyes cry and I held your face in my hand
And then I fell down yelling, “Make it go away!”
Just make her smile come back and shine just like it used to be
And then she whispered “How can you do this to me?”
Hate me today
Hate me tomorrow
Hate me for all the things I didn't do for you
Hate me in ways
Yeah, ways hard to swallow
Hate me so you can finally see what’s good for you
For you
For you
For you

What day is it? And in what month?
This clock never seemed so alive
I can't keep up and I can't back down
I've been losing so much time
'Cause it's you and me and all of the people with nothing to do
Nothing to lose
And it's you and me and all other people
And I don't know why, I can't keep my eyes off of you
All of the things that I want to say just aren't coming out right
I'm tripping on words
You've got my head spinning

Nothing to prove
And it's you and me and all other people

Everything she does is right

I Think They Like Me (Remix) Lyrics
Check it, check it, one, two, three
As it is plain to see
I go by the name of Jermaine Dupri
Dope Man Fresh in the place to be, and uh
Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I think they like me, oh, I think they like me
Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I think they like me, oh, I think they like me
Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I think they like me, oh, I think they like me
Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I think they like me, oh, I think they like me
Oh, I think they like me when they heard me on the other one
So it's only right that I hit you with a-
erritt-erritt
Oh, I think they like me when they heard me on the other one
So it's only right that I hit you with another one
Yeah niggas like me, haters wanna fight me
Yeah these bitches mad cause I came up overnight, B
Yeah I switched it up, I got a 9 cuffed tightly
So you'd better do the right thing like Spike Lee
Yeah I'm super clean,
rock jeans with a white tee
Niggas fucking soft but them niggas wanna bite me
If you had 6 figures you'd be just like me
Yeah these niggas mad cause I'm shining like a light beam
Niggas talkin bout YEP in they mother fucking throw back
He ain't real you know that, Muhammad where they sold that
We stepping on these niggas like a mother fucking door mat
When I hit the scene they take pictures, call me Kodak
These ho's goin crazy, yeah I think they need some prozac
We the hottest thing on the market and you know that
Ya bitch chosed up an she don't wanna go back
We stacking big faces cause we still spendin all that
When I do it, it's something like the
thriller in manilla,
man
Known as a killer man, fresh from the dealer man
So So niggas, ain't no crew iller than
10 acres of land and I got about a million
Dollars worth of cars in my front yard
I'm from the place in ATL where young niggas sling hard
Oh, I think they like me when they heard me on the other one
So it's only right that I hit you with another one
Remix, we gets busy over here
No sleep, niggas stay up on their grizzy over here
We young (young), we fly (fly)
We gonna stay flashy till the day that we die
Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I think they like me, oh, I think they like me
Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I think they like me, oh, I think they like me
Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I think they like me, oh, I think they like me
Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I think they like me, oh, I think they like me
They don't wanna fight me
I'm snatchin ya ass up
First nigga act up, the first nigga get bust
Majestic getting shredded while I'm twirling and switching so
T-shirt stravaganza, (Franchize, dem White Tee boyz)
Self made self paid
We lounge around in our white tee
Ashy black shirt well deep down to ya brown tee
My hundred throwback who sport a jersey by Ali
And if he make one, hell naw they dont psych me
I'm all about my cash, ridin' around wit a nice piece
Ear piece, ice piece, they straight like me
You heard pimping player (yeah they shine so brightly)
Don't stand so close vision blurs when ice blings
Respect my whole squad, no, you can't even touch us, cuz
Role out the red carpet, high 5 and show us love
Carry barrettas, count cheddar, we trendsetters
I'm a Franchize nigga, half a mil' or betta
Check it out,
Six 0, six four four
, six nine four
Blow 'dro with the windows up on deuce four's
Purple candy paint, brand new, think I ain't
Same chick, same clique, more bricks in the bank
Know now, no ho round, throw down like Brat
It ain't no showdown for no crown, I'm holding that (thats right)
They saw me on VH, pay great till this day
Been in love with the mic since Run-D.M.C. walked this way
I talk this way cause I'm gangsta a chi-town legend
I'm not ordinary people it's a star in your presence
I'm so icy that my earlobes hurt for what its worth
Don't test me I got the four fifth under the skirt
Thick in the thighs can't touch that
Stay on my grind, I bust back if I must act and empty a stack
Its B to the R-A-T trust that I'm crazy,
JD pays me,
I'm such a fucking lady
I'm Bow Weezy, prince of the O-town
Just got the wheels clean, so I'm riding slow now
I'm in a fast car, something like a NASCAR
If you wanna know how much it cost you should ask pa
As far as the watch and chain
I dropped some change, its easy for me to cop them things
And I don't stop, I got rocks and rings, you know
The same size as a boxing ring
Swimming pool in the front and the back yard
I ain't gotta act hard, I'm under 21 with a black card
And yea I know that was kind of a low blow
But the dough for the So So don't come slow
Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I think they like me, oh, I think they like me
Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I think they like me, oh, I think they like me
Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I think they like me, oh, I think they like me
Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I think they like me, oh, I think they like me
Oh, I think they like me when they heard me on the other one
So it's only right that I hit you with a--
erritt-erritt
Oh, I think they like me when they heard me on the other one
So it's only right that I hit you with another one"

Ah, look, we gotta talk
Dang, I know, I know but it's, it's just, it's just
Some things I gotta get off my chest, aight
Yeah, woah, woah-woah
Listen
Baby, come here and sit down, let's talk
I got a lot to say so I guess I'll start by
Saying that I love you
But you know, this thing ain't been no walk in the park for us
I swear it'll only take a minute
You'll understand when I finish, yeah
And I don't wanna see you cry
But I don't wanna be the one to tell you a lie so
How do you let it go when you, you just don't know
What's on the other side of the door when you're walking out? Talk about it
And everything I tried to remember to say just went out my head
So I'ma do the best I can to get you to understand 'cause I know
There's never a right time to say goodbye (Yeah)
But I gotta make the first move
'Cause if I don't you gonna start hating me
'Cause I really don't feel the way I once felt about you
Girl, it's not you, it's me, I
Kinda gotta figure out what I need, oh
There's never a right time to say goodbye
But we know that we gotta go our separate ways
And I know it's hard but I gotta do it and it's killing me
'Cause there's never a right time, right time to say goodbye
Girl, I know your heart is breaking
And a thousand times I found myself asking, ""Why? Why?""
Why am I taking so long to say this?
But trust me, girl, I never
Meant to crush your world and I never
Thought I would see the day we grew apart
And I wanna know
How do you let it go when you, you just don't know
What's on the other side of the door when you're walking out? Talk about it
Girl, I hope you understand what I'm tryna say, we just can't go on
Pretending that we get along, girl, how you not gon' see it? (Oh, oh, yeah)
There's never a right time to say goodbye
But I gotta make the first move
'Cause if I don't you gonna start hating me
'Cause I really don't feel the way I once felt about you
Girl, it's not you, it's me, I
Kinda gotta figure out what I need, oh
There's never a right time to say goodbye
But we know that we gotta go our separate ways
And I know it's hard but I gotta do it and it's killing me
'Cause there's never a right time, right time to say goodbye
Listen to your heart, girl, you know
We should be apart, baby, I
I just can't do it, I, I just can't do it
Listen to your heart, girl, you know
We should be apart, baby, I
I just can't do it and sometimes it makes me wanna cry
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Do you hear me crying?
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (Oh, oh)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
There's never a right
There's never a right time to say goodbye (Oh yeah)
But I gotta make the first move
'Cause if I don't you gonna start hating me (You gonna start hating me, baby)
'Cause I really don't feel the way I once felt about you (No more)
Girl, it's not you, it's me, I (It's me, yeah)

There's never a right time to say goodbye (Oh, no it ain't)
But we know that we gotta go our separate ways (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
And I know it's hard but I gotta do it and it's killing me
'Cause there's never a right time, right time to say goodbye (Right time)
There's never a right time to say goodbye
But I gotta make the first move
'Cause if I don't you gonna start hating me
'Cause I really don't feel the way I once felt about you

Waiting on the World to Change Lyrics
One, two
One, two, three
Me and all my friends
We're all misunderstood
They say we stand for nothing and
There's no way we ever could
Now we see everything that's going wrong
With the world and those who lead it
We just feel like we don't have the means
To rise above and beat it
So we keep waiting (Waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting (Waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
It's hard to beat the system
When we're standing at a distance
So we keep waiting (Waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
Now if we had the power
To bring our neighbors home from war
They would have never missed a Christmas
No more ribbons on their door
And when you trust your television
What you get is what you got
'Cause when they own the information, oh
They can bend it all they want
That's why we're waiting (Waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting (Waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
It's not that we don't care
We just know that the fight ain't fair
So we keep on waiting (Waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
[Guitar Solo]
And we're still waiting (Waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting (Waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
One day our generation
Is gonna rule the population
So we keep on waiting (Waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
Now we keep on waiting (Waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting (Waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
Waiting on the world to change
Waiting on the world to change
Waiting on the world to change"

The Recession Lyrics
Don't talk to me' I don't gossip about no drama
Don't speak unless it's with intelligence like Barack Obama
I'm magniloquent' I express myself in high flown language
If you catch me slipping I apologize' for not displaying greatness
Baby I'm about to blow
Now is not the time for games or jokes
I need some music I can bob my head to when I'm broke
Need a woman' I need a woman' that bitch not for me
I like the way she look but I don't like the way that she think
I need a J.O.B'
Rather flipping burgers or fifty-packs in the street
You got that fire tree well nigga give me that for my grief
Mama's only son breathing soul bleeding so deep yo throat fill up
I'm here for one reason' to tell you people dont give up
This Scatta G
I'm never gone give up' I promise we gone rise
I know it because I believe in GOD
So I'm going Hard
In this recession praying for blessings
Stressing my message
My way of releasing pain for all this hell I been catching
To all my fathers' Please don't give up
My single mothers' Please' Just don't give up
And all my hustlers' Please don't give up
Silly suckers who don't me
I suggest you leave me lonely
Trying to act hard you phoney
If you want me I'm coming hommie
Cause bitch I'm about to blow
Like the stash pot at the King Pens trap
Haters say I need to grow some fucking more
Well they need to learn how to rap
You can never say I have no love loyalty or respect for the trap
Shit' I ain't even from the way and I put that on the map
Pick yo face up off the pavement'
And ask them women about me'
Bet they say I hit slow'
Shit' they love me'
Because bitch I'm me like Brisco
Don't judge me'
Unless you feel the pain in my pit too'
Disgusting'
A horror movie'
This just the preview
Don't make me meet you treat you then leave you where you lay for trying to play with me
I'm prisoner of my own pain'
Can you define slavery'
I'm education to the streets'
Yall since-less when yall hating me'
This name this fame this brain this pain this game
This what yall gave to me
I'm a soul survivor like Young Jeezy and Akon on a nigga
I got my own problems' never had the nerve to hate another nigga
I'd rather display my love loyalty and respect on a track with them
Never ignorant getting goals accomplished' It's an acronym
I've been sacrificing to get a job' believe it or not
Me and the music go together like a plant and a pot
Life s crazy I've had enough' but never had enough of gripping the guap
So don't hate me if you fuck around and catch me kicking a rock
Baby I'm about to blow'
I can't rush God's work because he in control
All of my ladies' you got to hold on to your love like Envogue
Stay strong for the men who out they mind' Don't let them lose they soul
Rather he work a nine to five or he move that blow
If he provide, respect him and let him know
He the man around this motherfucker
Who real enough to catch a cold get sick break down the dro and roll one up separate
Give you yo own blunt because I don't want you catching shit
Some education and common since is what you better get
So proud every time I turn on my TV and see my president
Black beautiful and rich' with an even richer personality
I'm talking Barack Obama'
I'm talking about Scatta G
I'm talking about Michael Jordan
I'm talking about Michael Jackson
I'm talking about Missy Elliot Young Lloyd and Nelly
And my music make haters feel so worthless'
They gone site down and do some soul searching'
Eliminate the hate'
I'm a doctor on the track' a cold surgeon'
I'll kill you niggas with my old verses'
Ask me to demonstrate'
No' No'
You don't deserve to see royalty when we rock and roll
And you don't wanna see me when I got a knot to cop a Glock
Because I won't hesitate to make it cock back and explode
In yo motherfucking face' Bitch'
So find yo little ass somebody else to play wit'
Because I'll sit back' watch you get started and finished'
Six feet up under the village'
Before I get a chance to say shit'
Tell me who really handling business'
And turn everything secondary until business get finished
Never thought I would meet someone who would have to serve their life in prison'
Somebody snitchin'
Which makes it appropriate enough for me to mention'
Im 22 with no kids'
I guess I just don't look good enough for the bitches'
I love a woman that can move me'
Sooth me'
And in any situation she keep it groovy'
Little black cutie'
Little fat booty'
If it ain't me she giving nobody that coochie ma'
Gotta ride two seat'
Like Yo Gotti and Gucci Man"

When I’m Gone Lyrics
Yeah, it's my life (
Hey, Hailie
)
In my own words, I guess
Have you ever loved someone so much you'd give an arm for?
Not the expression, no, literally give an arm for
When they know they're your heart and you know you are their armor
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her
But what happens when karma turns right around to bite you?
And everything you stand for turns on you to spite you?
What happens when you become the main source of her pain?
""Daddy, look what I made!"" ""Dad's gotta go catch a plane""
""Daddy, where's Mommy? I can't find Mommy, where is she?""
""I don't know, go play, Hailie, baby, your daddy's busy
Daddy's writin' a song, the song ain't gon' write itself
I'll give you one underdog, then you gotta swing by yourself""
Then turn right around on that song and tell her you love her
And put hands on her mother who's a spittin' image of her
That's Slim Shady, yeah, baby, Slim Shady's crazy
Shady made me, but tonight Shady's rock-a-bye baby, ha
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing, so, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing, so, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back
I keep havin' this dream, I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing
She keeps screamin' she don't want me to sing
""You're makin' Mommy cry, why? Why is Mommy cryin'?""
""Baby, Daddy ain't leavin' no more"" ""Daddy, you're lyin'
You always say that, you always say, 'This is the last time'
But you ain't leavin' no more, Daddy, you're mine""
She's pilin' boxes in front of the door, tryna block it
""Daddy, please! Daddy, don't leave! Daddy, no, stop it!""
Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket
It's got a picture, ""This'll keep you safe, Daddy, take it wit' ya""
I look up, it's just me standin' in the mirror
These fuckin' walls must be talkin' 'cause, man, I can hear 'em
They're sayin', ""You got one more chance to do right, and it's tonight
Now go out there and show 'em that you love 'em 'fore it's too late""
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door
It turns to a stage, they're gone and the spotlight is on, and I'm singin'
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing, so, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing, so, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back
Sixty-thousand people all jumpin' out their seat
The curtain closes, they're throwin' roses at my feet
I take a bow and ""Thank you all for comin' out""
They're screamin' so loud, I take one last look at the crowd
I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seein'
""Daddy, it's me! Help Mommy, her wrists are bleedin'!""
""But, baby, we're in Sweden, how did you get to Sweden?""
""I followed you, Daddy, you told me that you weren't leavin'
You lied to me, Dad, and now you made Mommy sad
And I bought you this coin, it says 'Number One Dad'
That's all I wanted, I just wanna give you this coin
I get the point, fine, me and Mommy are goin'""
""But, baby, wait!"" ""It's too late, Dad, you made the choice
Now go up there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us
That's what they want, they want you, Marshall, they keep
Screamin' your name,
it's no wonder you can't go to sleep
Just take another pill,
yeah, I bet you, you will
You rap about it, yeah, word, k-keep it real""
I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see
How could it be that the curtain is closin' on me?
I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it
Put it to my brain, scream, ""Die, Shady!"", and pop it
The sky darkens, my life flashes
The plane that I was supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes
That's when I wake up, alarm clock's ringing, there's birds singin'
It's spring and Hailie's outside swingin'
I walk right up to Kim and kiss her, tell her I miss her
Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister, almost as if to say
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing, so, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing, so, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back

(Juicy)
They call me the Juice, and you know I'ma stunt
Riding in the car with some bump in the trunk
Tone in my lap and you know it's a pump
Breaking down the good green, rolling the blunt
Ghetto pimp type, girls say I'm the man
Ice on the wrist with the ice in the chain
Riding through the hood, got me gripping the grain
And I'm sipping the same while I'm changing the lane
Eyes real tight, 'cause I'm choking the green
Vision messed up, 'cause I'm
drinking the lean
Messing with a D-boy, riding them big toys
Make your main gal wanna get on my team
She gotta give it up 'fore she get in my car
I ain't Denzel, but I know I'm a star
'Cause when I'm in the club, I be back in the fog (Yeah)
In the V.I.P. part and be buying the bar (Yeah)
DJ Paul is a dog, one you do not trust
You leave your green around me, nigga, yo' green gon' get lit up
You leave your drank around me, believe yo' drank gon' get drunk up
You leave your girl around me, if she bad, she gonna get stuck
These niggas is spies
We live them lives and keep them eyes tight
Riding 'round what they like
Make a couple nuns a couple of dykes
So purple, purple, purple, and swallow it down
With the yurple, yurple, yurple, it's going down
I gotta stay high-igh-igh-igh, igh-igh, igh-igh, igh
'Til I die-ie-ie-ie, ie-ie, ie-ie, ie
I gotta stay high-igh-igh-igh, igh-igh, igh-igh, igh
'Til I die-ie-ie-ie, ie-ie, ie-ie, ie
Puff, puff, pass, nigga, roll that blunt
Let's get high, nigga, smoke us one (Yeah!)
Paul pulled out the Phantom, niggas can't stand it
But them hoes gon' come (Oh!)
I just really wanna smoke my weed
Fuck these hoes and stack my G's (Yes!)
Stop at the light and pause on Three
Hit the mall and it be all on me, but (Let's go!)
Gotta keep one eye up on the po-po
Close the window when I roll the indo (Get high!)
Know they mad 'cause I'm rolling Benzo
This that purple, not pretendo (Nah)
Three 6 Mafia, them my kinfolks
So when I'm in Memphis, Ten-a-key
I just might not bring my own
'Cause them niggas there let me smoke for free
What's up, Mary? How you doing?
Mary Jane stalking me
Since I have met you, girl, you're on my brain (On my brain)
You stole my heart (Stole my heart)
Right from the start (Right from the start)
So I broke you down
Look, momma, put you in the 'gar (Put you in the 'gar)
I gotta stay high-igh-igh-igh, igh-igh, igh-igh, igh
'Til I die-ie-ie-ie, ie-ie, ie-ie, ie
I gotta stay high-igh-igh-igh, igh-igh, igh-igh, igh
'Til I die-ie-ie-ie, ie-ie, ie-ie, ie
(Yeah)
Premro full of that dro
Leave the club, full of Rosé Mo
Your girlfriend wanna ride with me
In a car with a pimp, where she supposed to be
You ain't met no dude spit it cold as me
The bag of kush, it cost 650
Have a nigga who smoke Reggie Miller
Coughing and choking constantly
Taste like fruit when you hit it
Gotta have bread to get it
Smoke all night, sleep all day
That's to me the American way
Roll that shit, light that shit
Hit that shit, hold that shit
Blow that shit out slow
Then pass it to me, bro
MJ finna sprinkle in some of that
Super incredible, have a nigga runnin' back
Where the nigga with the good sticky number at?
Cut open a cigarillo like a lumberjack
In the morning, what I need is to
Breathe again, a whole lot of weed
But I'm needing somebody to give me what I need
When I want nothing less than the best of the trees
DJ Paul and Juicy J, 8Ball & MJG
And Young Buck, we don't give a fuck, we must represent this Tennessee
We drink a whole lot of Hennessy, you know a nigga got a lil' hair on his chest
Do me like Bill Clinton girl, take it out your mouth, we'll shoot it right there on your dress
I gotta stay high-igh-igh-igh, igh-igh, igh-igh, igh"

I used to think that I wasn't fine enough
And I used to think that I wasn't wild enough
But I won't waste my time tryna figure out
Why you playing games, what's this all about?
And I can't believe you're hurting me
I met your girl, what a difference
What you see in her, you ain't seen in me
But I guess it was all just make believe
Oh love, never knew what I was missin'
But I knew once we start kissin', I found
Love, never knew what I was missin'
But I knew once we start kissin', I found
Found you
Now you're gone, what am I gonna do?
So empty, my heart, my soul can't go on
Go on without you
My rainy days fade away when you come around
Please tell me, baby
Why you go so far away? Why you go
Love, never knew what I was missin'
But I knew once we start kissin', I found
Love, never knew what I was missin'
But I knew once we start kissin', I found, I found you
(
Who would have known
)
I'd found you
(Ooh)
Now you're gone, what am I gonna do?
So empty, my heart, my soul can't go on
Go on, baby, without you
Rainy days fade away
When you come around, say you're here to stay
With me, boy, I don't want you to leave me, I
I need you
Love, never knew what I was missin' (I never knew)
But I knew once we start kissin', I found
Love, never knew what I was missin' (I never, never, never)
But I knew once we start kissin', I found, I found

When You’re Mad Lyrics
It's just the cutest thing
When you get to fussing (Cussing)
Yelling and throwing things
I just wanna eat you up
I don't mean no disrespect
When I start staring
Knowing that it makes you madder (Uh, oh)
I'm sorry
But seeing you mad is so sexy
Could it be the little wrinkle over your nose
When you make your angry face
That makes me wanna just take off all your clothes
And sex you all over the place
Could it be the lil' way you storm around
That makes me wanna tear you down
Baby, I ain't sure
But one thing that I do know is
Every time you scream at me
I wanna kiss you
Baby when you put your hands on me
I wanna touch you
And when we get to arguing
Just gotta kiss you
Baby, I don't know why it's like that
But you're just so damn sexy
When you're mad
Baby, don't think I don't take you seriously
But I just can't help the fact
That your attitude excites me
(So exciting)
And you know ain't nothing better
Then when we get
Mad together and have angry sex
(I'll blow you out)
Then we forget what we were mad about
Could it be the little wrinkle over your nose
When you make your angry face
That makes me wanna just take off all your clothes
And sex you all over the place
Could it be the lil' way you storm around
That makes me wanna tear you down
Baby, I ain't sure
But one thing that I do know is
Every time you scream at me
I wanna kiss you
Baby when you put your hands on me
I wanna touch you
And when we get to arguing
Just gotta kiss you
Baby, I don't know why it's like that
But you're just so damn sexy
When you're mad
Every time you scream at me
I wanna kiss you
Baby when you put your hands on me
I wanna touch you
And when we get to arguing
Just gotta kiss you
Baby, I don't know why it's like that
But you're just so damn sexy
When you're mad"

Hey, T.I.P. pimpin'
Hey, shorty, why you gotta act like that?
I'm sayin', I'm just tryin' to be nice to you
Go and tell a nigga no with a ass so fat
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that?
In a relationship, been faithful to a nigga so wack
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that… aye-aye
Can't help but notice how you glowing, I can see in yo' face
Now, I just wonder if he know he close to being replaced
Swear I treat you like a queen you put me in his place
So you can give back his ring and the key to his place
Tell the nigga one thing, that you need your space
Selling niggas one thing, you don't need to chase
I wanna kiss you everywhere between your knees and waist
Hear the sounds that you make and get your knees to shake
Holla at me in the A, you feel you need to escape
I got a mansion and a gate, you with me and you safe
A Benz, a Phantom and a truck with 23's the case
600 G's in the safe, how much cheese it take?
This a chance you need to take, ain't no need to wait
Say the word, we can leave today, this song's special
And it feel like fate, hate to make a mistake
How the same thing making you sad making you stay?
Go and tell a nigga no with a ass so fat
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that?
In a relationship, been faithful to a nigga so wack
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that… aye-aye
Can he touch it like that, and make it feel like this?
How I left and came back and it's still like this?
Do he hit it from the back and make you feel it in your chest?
Take advantage of what you're concealing in your dress?
What, he think he too fresh to show that you the best?
Compliment you on your intellect and treat you with respect?
Give you sex 'til you sweat, tongue kissing on your neck?
It's been awhile since she got it like this, I bet
I can tell you ain't just another bitch I met
Ain't nobody got me open like this, not yet
You confused, ain't decided which way you should go yet
So how you keep saying no with your panties so wet?
Go and tell a nigga no with a ass so fat
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that?
In a relationship, been faithful to a nigga so wack
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that… aye-aye
[Interlude]
Ay, this nigga playing mind games, man
I think the time came that your mind changed, you understand?
Life is like a chess move
You need to make your next move your best move
Keep it pimpin', you understand? Hey
I mean, you know what I'm saying
I done showed you how I feel, you know what I'm saying
I put myself all the way out there, you know
The ball in your court, man
But I just got a question for you: Is you happy?
Go and tell a nigga no with a ass so fat
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that?
In a relationship, been faithful to a nigga so wack
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that… aye-aye
Go and tell a nigga no with a ass so fat
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that?
In a relationship, been faithful to a nigga so wack
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?

Stupid girl (

Maybe if I act like that, that guy will call me back
Porno paparazzi girl (
Yeah
)
, I don't wanna be a stupid girl (
Uh, uh

Go to Fred Segal, you'll find them there
Laughin' loud so all the little people stare
Lookin' for a daddy to pay for the champagne
(Drop a name)
What happened to the dream of a girl president?
She's dancing in the video next to 50 Cent
They travel in packs of two and three
With their itsy-bitsy doggies and their teeny-weeny tees
Where, oh where, have the smart people gone?
Oh where, oh where could they be?
(
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
)
Maybe if I act like that (
Woo
), that guy will call me back (
Uh-huh, uh-huh
)
Porno paparazzi girl, I don't wanna be a stupid girl
Baby, if I act like that, flippin' my blonde hair back
(
Yeah
)
Push up my bra like that
I don't wanna be a stupid girl
(
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
)
(
Let's break it down now
)
The disease is growing, it's epidemic
I'm scared that there ain't a cure
The world believes it and I'm going crazy
I cannot take anymore
I'm so glad that I'll never fit in
That will never be me
Outcasts and girls with ambition
That's what I wanna see (
Come on
)
Disasters all around (Disasters all around)
A world of despair (A world of despair)
Your only concern: ""Will it fuck up my hair?""
Maybe if I act like that, that guy will call me back (
Yeah, like this, woo
)
Porno paparazzi girl, I don't wanna be a stupid girl
Baby, if I act like that, flippin' my blonde hair back (
Uh-huh, uh-huh, and do your thing
)
Push up my bra like that, I don't wanna be a stupid girl (
Do your thing, yeah, yeah, uh
)
(
Do your thing, and do your thing, do your thing, and do your thing, do your thing
?)
(
I like this, like this, like this
)
Pretty, will you fuck me, girl? Silly, I'm so lucky, girl
Pull my hair, I'll suck it, girl, stupid girl
Pretty, will you fuck me, girl? Silly, I'm so lucky, girl
Pull my hair, I'll suck it, girl, stupid girl
(Baby, if I) Baby, if I act like that, flippin' my blonde hair back
(Baby, if I) Push up my bra like that
Stupid girl
Maybe if I act like that (Maybe if I act like that)
That guy will call me back (That guy will call me back)
Porno paparazzi girl (Porno paparazzi girl)
I don't wanna be a stupid girl (Stupid girls)
Baby, if I act like that (Baby, if I act like that)

Push up my bra like that (Push up my bra like that)
I don't wanna be a stupid girl (Stupid girls)
Baby, if I act like that (Stupid girls)

All she doin' is actin' like she want me
She cuttin' off all my homies
Even all my other ronis
She ain't even my main lady
See I been thinkin' bout it lately
Man she really don't deserve me
All she wanna do is hurt me
So I gotta get away from her
But now I'm leaving quickly
Before she come and try to get me
And I'm takin' everything with me
Well it all come down to her

It's been a couple of days
But now I'm doin' what I want to
With nobody tellin' me what I'm gon' do
And I'm feelin' so free
With nobody but me
Now I can handle all my business
All of my fellas, can I get a witness?
But I'm feelin' kinda lonely
On top of that I'm kinda horny
And I gotta get back to her
Now I'm leavin' quickly
Before she come and try to get me
And I'm takin' everything with me
Well it all come down to her
I'm sprung
Dawg, she got me
Got me doin' things I'll never do

Do I Make You Proud Lyrics
I've never been
The one to raise my hand
That was not me
And now that's who I am
Because of you
I am standing tall
My heart is full
Of endless gratitude
You were the one
The one to guide me through
Now I can see
And I believe
It's only just beginning
This is what we dream about
But the only question with me now
Is do I make you proud
Stronger than I've ever been now
Never been afraid of standing out
But do I make you proud?
I guess I've learned
To question is to grow
That you still have faith
Is all I need to know
I've learned to love
Myself in spite of me
And I've learned to
Walk on the road that I believe
This is what we dream about
But the only question with me now
Is do I make you proud
Stronger than I've ever been now
Never been afraid of standing out
But do I make you proud?
Everybody needs to rise up
Everybody needs to be loved
To be loved
This is what we dream about
But the only question with me now
Is do I make you, do I make you proud
This is what we dream about
But the only question with me now
Is do I make you proud
Stronger than I've ever been now (stronger than I've ever been)
Never been afraid of standing out (never been afraid)
But do I make you proud?
This is what we dream about
But the only question with me now
Is do I make you proud
Stronger than I've ever been now
Never been afraid of standing out
Do I make you proud?
But do I make you proud?
This is what we dream about
But the only question with me now
Is do I make you, do I make you proud"

Alright, yeah
I'm wandering the streets in a world underneath it all
Nothing seems to be
Nothing tastes as sweet as what I can't have
Like you and the way that you're twisting your hair 'round your finger
Tonight I'm not afraid to tell you
What I feel about you
Oh, I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have
And cannon ball into the water
I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have
For you I will
Forgive me if I st-stutter from all of the clutter in my head
Cause I could fall asleep in those eyes
Like a water-bed
Do I seem familiar? I've crossed you in hallways a thousand times
No more camouflage, I wanna be exposed
And not be afraid to fall
Oh, I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have
And cannon ball into the water
I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have
For you I will
Always want what you can't have
But I've got to try
I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have
For you I will
For you I will
For you I will
For you
If I could dim the lights in the mall and create a moon
Yeah, I would
And shout out your name so it echoes in every room, yeah
That's what I'd do
That's what I'd do
To get through to you, yeah
Oh, I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have
And cannon ball into the water
I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have
For you I will
You always want what you can't have
But I've got to try
I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have
For you I will
For you I will
For you I will
For you I will"
